New Dungeons & Dragons Movie Plays Like Best D&D Game
time movie studio tries adapt beloved property, plays dangerous game: one could win millions dollars devoted fans, alienate entirely. every Lord Rings, hundred Hobbits. it’s always easy predict aspects original book, show, comic fans want see big screen.
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves problem multiple times over. Dungeons & Dragons (the game) isn’t one story. It’s tabletop role-playing game players drunk idiot friends take direction imaginable. countless existing narratives adapted, stories starting points. Chances slim studio filmmaker correctly guesses D&D fans might want movie adaptation. in-jokes, bizarre encounters, recklessly stupid decisions shouldn’t work do—they’re bespoke player’s experience.
Yet somehow, Honor Among Thieves manages zero players’ energy, specifics. heroes, Chris Pine’s bard Edgin Justice Smith’s sorcerer Simon, form unlikely party existing interconnected allegiances, grudges, relationships. would die other. can’t stand other. they’re thrust together just-plausible-enough circumstances. words, it’s chaotic silly typical D&D game.
say everything repeatedly consistently goes rails.
story centers around Edgin, who’s trying get daughter back prison years and, can, resurrect deceased wife he’s it. best barbarian pal Holga (Michelle Rodriguez) journey, duo put together crew, Ocean’s 11–style, save Edgin’s daughter evil “uncle” Forge (Hugh Grant).
paper, story feels almost paint-by-numbers. There’s tendency view blockbuster movies rely heavily fetch quests tangents bloated messy. (The bizarre knife-map Star Wars: Episode IX—The Rise Skywalker comes mind.) Yet, Honor Among Thieves, every quest—including magical heist undead interrogations—feels like matters. quests drive central plot forward, importantly, create fun ride gives party members chance connect. treasure truly friends made along way.
story lacks heart. Writer director duo Jonathan Goldstein John Francis Daley seem get players love D&D. game may known wacky antics absurd detours, there’s reason people still gravitate romantic, fantasy setting. laughs shenanigans, characters heartfelt moments fall love, avenge friend, mourn comrade.
movie relies heavily tropes manage avoid feeling tropey? It’s authentic source material. Whoever cast Pine bard deserves raise. Rodriguez sells barbarian-with-a-heart-of-gold archetype perfectly. Smith charming bumbling sorcerer, Sophia Lillis nails energy one friend wrote brooding character doesn’t like people, go along party otherwise even playing us, Becky?
It’s almost hard tell whether intentional not—until arrival Regé-Jean Page’s paladin Xenk, clearly one guy table taking role-playing way seriously anyone else. presence illuminates that, anything, Goldstein Daley didn’t set fill movie D&D archetypes, much archetypes game's players, give players setting-appropriate characters.
vein, Honor Among Thieves almost could gone even meta did, it’s probably wise didn’t. Pop culture already layered responses anticipated analysis—call Cinema Sins Effect—that refreshing see movie reveling simplicity exciting adventure.
doesn’t matter whether know bad guys lose heroes win. D&D players know intimately. want laugh characters, shocked creatively bizarre creatures magic world, feel heart break little.
film understands this, built characters relatable, could believe friends played film's exact story. connecting directly players, self-aware tone strikes resonant chord winks audience way obscure comic book references can’t. taps intimacy collective enjoyment way adaptations could ever pull off.
