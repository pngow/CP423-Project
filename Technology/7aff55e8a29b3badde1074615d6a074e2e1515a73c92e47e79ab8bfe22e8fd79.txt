ever story licensing rights deserved “based true story” treatment, it’s Tetris. Figuring legally distribute game may sound like boring legal discrepancy, game one developed Russia fall Soviet Union, quest secure rights real-life political thriller, perfect fodder cinematic drama. Watching director Jon S. Baird’s Tetris, though, pieces don’t fall place.
Tetris, today Apple TV+, explores complex legal history perspective Henk Rogers (played Taron Egerton). 1980s, game designer entrepreneur found entranced game playing trade show. went quest Russia secure rights game—a move pitted businessman Robert Stein (Toby Jones), publishing titan Robert Maxwell, even KGB. Ultimately, ability connect Tetris developer Alexey Pajitnov (Nikita Efremov) allows secure game bring bajillion Game Boys, everything moment involves twists legalese one possibly imagine.
sounds like kind thing could watch two-hour YouTube video essay pause once, is. you’re looking sleek dramatized version story, Tetris delivers. film also somewhat undercut struggle portray certain nuances. times, falls rather shallow worldview “capitalism good, communism bad.” isn’t necessarily due failure character development—there plenty capitalist villains running around too. Soviet characters come slightly fleshed Tim Curry escaping one place hasn’t corrupted capitalism.
