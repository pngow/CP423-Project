Microsoft’s ‘Security Copilot’ Unleashes ChatGPT Breaches
years now, “artificial intelligence” hot buzzword cybersecurity industry, promising tools spot suspicious behavior network, quickly figure what's going on, guide incident response there's intrusion. credible useful services, though, actually machine learning algorithms trained spot characteristics malware dubious network activity. Now, generative AI tools proliferate, Microsoft says finally built service defenders that's worthy hype.
Two weeks ago, company launched Microsoft 365 Copilot, builds partnership OpenAI along Microsoft's work large language models. company rolling Security Copilot, sort security field notebook integrates system data network monitoring security tools like Microsoft Sentinel Defender even third-party services.
Security Copilot surface alerts, map words charts may going within network, provide steps potential investigation. human user works Copilot map possible security incident, platform tracks history generates summaries, colleagues get added project, quickly come speed see what's done far. system also automatically produce slides presentation tools investigation help security teams communicate facts situation people outside department, particularly executives may security experience need stay informed.
“Over past years, we’ve seen absolute escalation frequency attacks, sophistication attacks, well intensity attacks,” says Vasu Jakkal, Microsoft’s chief vice president security. “And lot time defender contain escalation attack. balance right shifted direction attackers.”
Jakkal says machine learning security tools effective specific domains, like monitoring email activity individual devices—known endpoint security—Security Copilot brings separate streams together extrapolates bigger picture. “With Security Copilot catch others may missed forms connective tissue,” says.
Security Copilot largely powered OpenAI's ChatGPT-4, Microsoft emphasizes also integrates proprietary Microsoft security-specific model. system tracks everything that's done investigation. resulting record audited, materials produces distribution edited accuracy clarity. something Copilot suggesting investigation wrong irrelevant, users click “Off Target” button train system.
platform offers access controls certain colleagues shared particular projects others, especially important investigating possible insider threats. Security Copilot allows sort backstop 24/7 monitoring. way, even someone specific skillset working given shift given day, system offer basic analysis suggestions help plug gaps. example, team wants quickly analyze script software binary may malicious, Security Copilot start work contextualize software behaving goals may be.
Microsoft emphasizes customer data shared others “not used train enrich foundation AI models.” Microsoft pride itself, though, using “65 trillion daily signals” massive customer base around world inform threat detection defense products. Jakkal colleague, Chang Kawaguchi, Microsoft's vice president AI security architect, emphasize Security Copilot subject data-sharing restrictions regulations security products integrates with. already use Microsoft Sentinel Defender, Security Copilot must comply privacy policies services.
Kawaguchi says Security Copilot built flexible open-ended possible, customer reactions inform future feature additions improvements. system's usefulness ultimately come insightful accurate customer’s network threats face. Kawaguchi says important thing defenders start benefiting generative AI quickly possible.
puts it: “We need equip defenders AI given attackers going use regardless do.”
