husband playing preposterously frustrating game every evening … well, don’t much else right now. Every time bug wonky sequence made one us throw controller shout, “Never again!” would pick next night.
pinpoint moment game’s problems crystallized me. climactic moment, clearly heart-wrenching situation written script. waited feelings, feelings, rise up. didn’t. Instead feeling sad, started feel … bored. disgusted. little manipulated.
Then, worst possible moment, bug showed up. “Wait, that’s chip,” husband said. “That’s gun. pulled gun ear.” ran office, opened laptop, began writing piece. can’t stand game, it’s almost unplayable. It’s poorly written. didn’t need abuse bunch developers fix that.
Heart Soul
context: don’t consider gamer. (Ed. note: totally are.) years ago, bought husband Nintendo Switch Christmas, two us played together ever since. like Mario Kart friends. Donut County funny. Breath Wild made gasp beauty, spent time collecting different-colored horses.
downloaded Witcher 3 whim, watched first episode Netflix show. opening sequence, transfixed. Witcher 3 everything people say is. Geralt compelling character wide array skills; Continent vast richly detailed; stakes high. It’s Law & Order: SVU meets Lord Rings.
that’s loved it. Despite fantastical monsters, felt real, forgave many bugs glitches (Still! Years launched!) story good. Witcher 3 paced like novel. heart, it’s Daddy Game. Geralt searching wife daughter. Nothing easier empathize that.
Despite length, it’s elegant economical. sets stakes within first minutes, dramatic opening sequence featuring lost Yennefer, training tutorial showing Geralt’s love creepy miniature Ciri. writing dry, funny, occasionally grotesque, grounded deep sympathetic understanding human nature.
example, “Family Matters”—a side quest Geralt tries help dissolute baron piece family back together—made laugh, cry, feel little sick once. everything I’ve ever wanted game. colleague Cecilia D’Anastasio put it, Witcher 3 One Game. idea might another game like it, soon, made dizzy.
Stupid Leather Dad Pants
me, nongamer, discourse Cyberpunk 2077’s poor performance feels like misses point. all, Witcher 3 full glitches, many become established inside jokes. It’s funny Geralt’s horse Roach keeps getting stuck improbable places. first started Cyberpunk—I’m playing Stadia—I got car stuck rock first five minutes.
Maybe Cyberpunk’s rhythms different due source material. Neuromancer, groundbreaking novel tabletop RPG based, accounts frenetic convoluted. week half in, I’m still invested.
hate characters, even ones tell I’m supposed like. Unlike Witcher’s goofy songster pal Dandelion, Cyberpunk sidekick Jackie Welles endearing characteristics besides dubious loyalty V lukewarm affection someone named Misty.

can’t keep track convoluted storyline. idea actions might help hurt eventual outcome. Everything feels like I’m killing time Keanu’s character, Johnny Silverhand, takes head. also hate Johnny Silverhand. know I’m supposed hate him, you’re also supposed feel drawn charisma, because, duh, Keanu.
don’t. feel sympathy spoiled, aging kid whining cigs, dumb '90s leather leggings might’ve cool 20 years ago look like something Mormon mommy blogger might wear get Christmas pictures taken strip mall.
blindly follow quest tracker, don’t know else do, don’t know I’m supposed this. Unlike Witcher side quests quickly pulled heartstrings—a lost child, two sisters fighting love werewolf—in Cyberpunk, stumbled across Wraiths hideout. shot guy. that? Wraiths? evidence I’m supposed collect? knows? cares?
Witcher 3, there’s timer make decisions, none decisions consequential. example, one sequence, seconds decide whether take hypodermic would revive me. sheer orneriness, let run out. died seconds later. take hypodermic advance, pretend say? create artificial sense investment?
Last night, spent 20 minutes clambering enormous, enormously detailed, junkyard. accomplished piss enough find road, shoot someone, take dumb Gremlin-looking car. much game, made head heart hurt think time, money, effort wasted creating elaborate card castle little inside.
That’s
Witcher’s sake, own, prepared accept much. prepared accept glitches, also general try-hardness all, '90s rock-dad outfits, stupid slang, cringe-inducing objective acquiring “street cred.”
played despite accusations transphobia racism. played despite blanching every time character screeched “You f*cking beeetches!” horrible Spanglish accent, obviously craven attempt create moment meme-able Geralt murmuring hilariously understated “Hrmm” “Oh f*ck.”
without soul—without main character struggling come terms meaning consciousness, aging, means human age all-powerful corporations overly extensive body mods—Cyberpunk 2077 hours-long slog Keanu Reeves cosplaying lead singer Lit grating head. may half-machine cyborgs, I’m still human enough want humanity game.
