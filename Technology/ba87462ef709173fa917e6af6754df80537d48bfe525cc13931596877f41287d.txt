stunning capabilities ChatGPT, chatbot startup OpenAI, triggered surge new interest investment artificial intelligence. late last week, OpenAI’s CEO warned research strategy birthed bot played out. unclear exactly future advances come from.
OpenAI delivered series impressive advances AI works language recent years taking existing machine-learning algorithms scaling previously unimagined size. GPT-4, latest projects, likely trained using trillions words text many thousands powerful computer chips. process cost $100 million.
company’s CEO, Sam Altman, says progress come making models bigger. “I think we're end era going these, like, giant, giant models,” told audience event held MIT late last week. “We'll make better ways.”
Meanwhile, numerous well-funded startups, including Anthropic, AI21, Cohere, Character.AI, throwing enormous resources building ever larger algorithms effort catch OpenAI’s technology. initial version ChatGPT based slightly upgraded version GPT-3, users also access version powered capable GPT-4.
Altman’s statement suggests GPT-4 could last major advance emerge OpenAI’s strategy making models bigger feeding data. say kind research strategies techniques might take place. paper describing GPT-4, OpenAI says estimates suggest diminishing returns scaling model size. Altman said also physical limits many data centers company build quickly build them.
Nick Frosst, cofounder Cohere previously worked AI Google, says Altman’s feeling going bigger work indefinitely rings true. He, too, believes progress transformers, type machine learning model heart GPT-4 rivals, lies beyond scaling. “There lots ways making transformers way, way better useful, lots don’t involve adding parameters model,” says. Frosst says new AI model designs, architectures, tuning based human feedback promising directions many researchers already exploring.
version OpenAI’s influential family language algorithms consists artificial neural network, software loosely inspired way neurons work together, trained predict words follow given string text.
first language models, GPT-2, announced 2019. largest form, 1.5 billion parameters, measure number adjustable connections crude artificial neurons.
time, extremely large compared previous systems, thanks part OpenAI researchers finding scaling made model coherent. company made GPT-2’s successor, GPT-3, announced 2020, still bigger, whopping 175 billion parameters. system’s broad abilities generate poems, emails, text helped convince companies research institutions push AI models similar even greater size.
ChatGPT debuted November, meme makers tech pundits speculated GPT-4, arrived, would model vertigo-inducing size complexity. Yet OpenAI finally announced new artificial intelligence model, company didn’t disclose big is—perhaps size longer matters. MIT event, Altman asked training GPT-4 cost $100 million; replied, “It’s that.”
Although OpenAI keeping GPT-4’s size inner workings secret, likely intelligence already comes looking beyond scale. possibility used method called reinforcement learning human feedback, used enhance ChatGPT. involves humans judge quality model’s answers steer towards providing responses likely judged high quality.
remarkable capabilities GPT-4 stunned experts sparked debate potential AI transform economy also spread disinformation eliminate jobs. AI experts, tech entrepreneurs including Elon Musk, scientists recently wrote open letter calling six-month pause development anything powerful GPT-4.
MIT last week, Altman confirmed company currently developing GPT-5. “An earlier version letter claimed OpenAI training GPT-5 right now,” said. “We not, time.”
