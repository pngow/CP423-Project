Best Overall
Coleman Dome Screen Room (6-Person)
Stroll campground America see plenty no-frills Coleman tents good reason. They're reasonably cheap, available anywhere, get job done. They're need, especially camping week two year.
top pick newcomers experienced alike. easy set up, provides good rain protection three-season comfort, price break bank—although jumped nearly $50 past year. forgo extra vestibule bug screen, Coleman Sundome Tent even cheaper. living southern United States, really appreciate bug barrier (and extra room stash stuff).
Best Family Tent

Habitude strong light. fits easily canoe paddleboard easy set up—the design simple poles color-coded. There's plenty floor space two adults, two toddlers, large-ish dog. also storage pockets, places hang lights, vestibule. major downside get quite much airflow picks. otherwise, good option family ready move past car camping quite prepared snap handles everyone's toothbrushes go full-on ultralight.
Best Budget Family Tent
camp weekends year want spend $600 top family pick, Coleman makes good alternative. offers 85 square feet living space easy set quickly. center, full six feet tall, though slope toward walls. Still, plenty roomy family five gear.
Coleman sells tent without rainfly, calling waterproof as-is. yet put serious storm, since company sell rainfly separately ($30 Amazon), suggest grabbing it. tent alone stands light rain, want heavy downpour without rainfly. also suggest sealing seams good seam sealer. See details waterproof tent.
Best Two-Person Tent
REI's Half Dome tent series popular choice backpackers many years. rugged, easy set up, offers generous living space two gear. mesh design, coupled rainfly good staking, stand storms roast camping midsummer heat. dual doors dual vestibules ensure climbing partner middle night. said, vestibules small side—big enough boots empty pack, much else.
Half Dome lightest tent list (see Copper Spur below), 4 pounds, heavy split two people. also like rainfly symmetrical—there's "front" "back," vestibules identical—which makes setup easier.
Best Ultralight Backpacking Tent
weight matters still want freestanding tent, Big Agnes Copper Spur series tough beat. I've used two-person four-person models years, Big Agnes continually refined design point nothing left complain about. recently tried updated one-person Copper Spur (8/10 WIRED Recommends) loved it. afford it, one best tents market. lightweight, easy set up, stable even strong winds. Copper Spur also livable, interior mesh pockets ingenious "awning" design makes getting snap.
criticism tight squeeze. long trip partner significant other, might want go next size up. three-person could spacious, comfortable living space two people gear, still lighter two-person tents. WIRED reviewer Matt Jancer owns tent broken pole section twice now. Make sure bring repair kit (after fact, Big Agnes replace pole section $5).
Best Super-Sturdy Backcountry Tent
Nemo's new Osmo fabric star show Dagger Osmo 3P (8/10, WIRED Recommends). new fabric resists sagging wet weather, means even rain coming down, fly not. also nice Osmo nylon-polyester blend made 100 percent recycled nylon polyester yarns, flame-retardant chemicals fluorinated water repellents (PFC PFAS). Nemo using new fabric backpacking tents.
new fabric great job, really love low ground sturdy is—it holds really well even strong (45 mph testing) wind. Pair sturdiness large, spacious vestibules roomy interior excellent stargazing potential thanks mesh roof, great backcountry tent. real downside weight. find 4 pounds fine split two people, ultralight-obsessed likely prefer Nemo’s Hornet Dragonfly tents.
Best Lightweight Family Tent
MSR Elixir 4 tent quite pricey Big Agnes Copper Spur, much heavier. used three kids, plenty interior space. said, three adults comfortable four. mesh top provides great ventilation warm summer nights (and leaving rainfly gave kids great view stars night). double vestibules enough room keep boots gear weather, crossover pole really helps keep walls steep, strong wind.
Going Solo
Sea Summit's ultralight Alto (8/10, WIRED Recommends) designed keep weight solo adventures. WIRED reviewer Matt Jancer recently took one Hawaii, notes despite mere 33-ounce weight, held abrasive volcanic rock heavy north shore winds Big Island Kauai. top's zippered vent probably mesh keep bugs flying tent’s inner outer walls, let's honest—bugs probably get anyway. use tiny zipper open close vent without leaving tent. tent Telos ($599) Sea Summit’s first tents, company nailed it. There's also two-person TR2 model ($549) like design need room.
Best Pop-Up Tent
We're saying Decathlon lying, get tent two seconds, better are. said, sets plenty fast, far faster anything else guide. freestanding, although maximum ventilation want use side guy ropes, help open space air flow.
Aside quick easy setup, makes Quechua special black fabric, gets pretty close darkness even broad daylight. makes good choice festivals day beach, anywhere want take nap get sun while.
Pick Perfect Tent
hundreds tents there. none top picks quite works you, things consider research.
Keep weather mind. “Three-season” “four-season” usually refers much ventilation (that is, mesh) tent has. three-season tent offer better ventilation harder time retaining heat. people, three-season tent fine. planning snowshoe backcountry, live northern climes want protection occasional early late winter squall, four-season tent might appropriate.
specs important?
Floor space: look dimensions, rather four-person six-person designations. tend assume campers pint-sized people. Remember probably want keep spare clothes backpack tent need long enough stretch comfortably height.
Headroom: stand tent? steep walls? steeper better, since gives space move around.
Vestibule: one? big enough store boots gear want stay dry want tent you? backpacking, big enough safely cook under?
Materials: days, tents made nylon that's coated polyurethane, silicone, acrylic help shed water. Most, all, tents come seam sealed water leak in, isn't, REI great guide yourself.
Less weight means money. always true, unfortunately, usually is. want go ultralight, going spend more. fork big bucks, ask yourself: really care saving 6 ounces? going notice 6 ounces end 20-mile day? answer yes, rejoice. internet subculture people obsess saving ounces. r/ultralight Reddit good place start research.
