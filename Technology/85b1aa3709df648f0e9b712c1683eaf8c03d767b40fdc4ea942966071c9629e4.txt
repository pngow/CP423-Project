Best Sandals
Xero Shoes Z-Trail
love shoes. shoes ever inspired write 1,000 words. really good. Think barefoot answer Chacos. Except Chacos like putting tractors feet, Z-Trails still flex bend walk, giving feet freedom movement expect barefoot shoe. Despite sandals, 10 millimeters cushion, padding shoes see here. makes Z-Trail good option newcomers. want even minimalist sandal, also love Xero's Z-Trek sandals ($60), less padding.
Best Budding Runners
Vapor Glove 3 first barefoot shoe ever tried. They're still fairly shoe-like, wide toe box tight heel cup. zero drop (the heel height forefoot) minimal padding, putting firmly barefoot shoe camp. solid, comfortable shoe fit wide range feet.
problem Merrell feels need update Vapor Glove constantly. us wearing like change. like-new Vapor Glove 3 sells eBay brand-new Vapor Glove 5 straight Merrell. That's say there's anything wrong Vapor Glove 5 (I tried yet), warning version favorite shoe ever, might want buy pairs. Vapor Glove 6 inevitably slightly different. use pairs like them. one thing like shoes last six months (I run 3-5 miles day).
Best Sandal Beginners
never run sandals before, Luna's Mono Winged Edition great way start. technically (and Luna) call “zero-drop,” rather “barefoot.” soles thick enough provide good cushion—you're less likely bruise feet first time run them. time, strap design allows ankle get used moving around way modern running shoes allow, easing transition sandals. That's say veteran barefoot runners enjoy well. love hard surfaces, like concrete asphalt. Experienced barefoot enthusiasts looking thinner sandal might like Luna's Venado sandals ($90), lack trail-friendly sole much thinner.
Best Trail Runners
wife came back first run Softstar Primal RunAmocs said good, she'd never wear shoe again. agree; favorite shoes running trails can't run sandals barefoot (usually due mud). soles minimal, like rest guide, reason seem softer let feel ground others. leather uppers softest leather I've ever owned and, surprisingly, make feet overly sweaty (which worried going in). toe box wide, almost comically so, wearing never want go back smaller toe box. toes move, better run.
routinely run muddy conditions, I'd suggest Megagrip model, uses Vibram sole traction it. suggestion use Softstar's sizing guide order full size bigger, three pairs tested small side. also note Softstar makes great barefoot shoes children well.
Best All-Around Shoe
Remember kid shoes? Like one pair shoes? shoes. shoes gym shoes night out, shoes. want return world minimalist fashion, recommend these. Xero calls “athleisure” shoes, gets appeal single word. They're trim, light, flexible, well ventilated, making good run, they're also nice enough wear around town causal shoe. want something even nicer, there's Prio Suede ($110, Men's/Women's), less shoe suede.
Best Slip-On
WIRED readers big Freet fans. got quite emails suggesting try these, I'm glad Tangas new favorite around-the-house shoes. single-piece mesh upper made recycled coffee grounds, lean positive side sliding scale environmental friendliness. They're also comfortable, mesh fabric nicely breathable warm days.
Tangas sport thicker 6.5-mm sole box, easy pull insole reduce 4 mm want thinner feel. makes good way start barefoot journey, since reduce amount padding go.
Best Hiking Boot
confess try wear shoes all. barefoot top pick guide reason. wear shoes see test them, left devices, I'd soon never wear shoes. said, Xero's Denver leather boot almost makes wish lived place need wear shoes remarkably comfortable, warm, perfect cold days experienced recent trip Wyoming. get minimal sole, reasonably wide toe box (very similar fit-wise HFS shoe below). flannel lining leather outer make warmest minimalist shoe I've ever worn—perfect winter.
Best Winter Boot (Women's)
slip-on boot kept daughter's feet warm cold winter beaches Texas frigid plains Colorado. technically slip-on, adjustable strap runs top arch, sole, buckle near back, means snug little need to. said fit pretty true size unless low arch, need strap much. last person want go fashion advice, eye look great, unless really know barefoot shoes, people probably notice anything cool boots.
Best Road Running
I've tried several Xero's various running shoes, HFS favorite running human-made surfaces like concrete asphalt. said, work great trails too. went backpacking mine 45-pound pack problems. Barefoot purists (yes, exist, see barefoot running subreddit) would argue pushing definition barefoot, let semantics get way great shoe? comfortable durable, offer 7 millimeters padding soften impact running hard surfaces.
Best Toe Freedom
Whenever told someone testing barefoot shoes, response usually, "Oh, like five-finger things?" Yes, classic, perhaps original barefoot shoe (if willing disregard millennia sandal-making around world).
Barefoot shoes everyone, FiveFingers especially everyone. like them, one people introduced barefoot shoes wearing nothing well decade swears them. find separation toes annoying, feel like gain anything way balance toes separated. people love FiveFingers, maybe worth trying curious. Head local running shoe store spend time decide yourself.
Best Around Town
Addis Vivobarefoot's take barefoot casual dress shoe. leather sourced independent Ethiopian cattle farmers—that's they're named Ethiopia's highland capital—and makes comfortable shoes I've ever worn.
looking shoe around town, one best-looking barefoot shoes find. leather soft, issues chaffing. mind wearing without socks; feet get sweaty leather, expected. said, they're definitely warmest shoes page, keep mind live someplace gets hot. Another thing note run wide—especially toe box. Try person can.
Best Minimalists
Modeled (somewhat) running sandal famous Tarahumara runners, Genesis sandal first exposure Xero Shoes. buy either DIY kit make sandals opt premade Genesis. fast becoming favorite shoes, beginners start here.
mere 4-millimeter sole shock cord hold feet. Despite apparent flimsiness, they're wonderful run great lounging around house. Buyer beware: take getting used to, cord running toes everyone.
Best Barefoot Water Shoes
Ever since went barefoot shoes, one thing I've really missing good pair water shoes—something paddling, stepping streams fishing, wading shallow bays old fishhooks might present. Xero's Aqua Cloud sandals pretty darn close after. They're similar Genesis above, extra grip foot bed raised heel cup keep sand gravel. result shoe that's comfortable performs well water.
found Aqua Cloud great fishing paddling. (I strapped front SUP tested footwear forays ashore.) Wading sandals best, that's true Aqua Cloud well trusty old Chacos. Still, go-to sandal things water related, whitewater rafting, one thing keep Chacos around for.
Get Started Barefoot Shoes
probably wearing padded shoes life. expect toss able mileage—whether walking running—in barefoot shoes. certain degree, must relearn run walk. going take conscious effort part, difficult. learning, also unlearning ingrained habits. key go slow. Very, very, absurdly slow.
approach barefoot shoes depends looking do. happened getting running, worked nicely take slow (I sucked). currently ultra-marathoner want try barefoot shoes, hard time holding back. somewhere poles, it'll still hard overdo it. Focus discipline usually use distance distance.
know start, check Graham Tuttle's YouTube channel, especially foot strengthening exercises. help develop foot ankle strength lack coming years padded shoes, help reduce muscle soreness getting started barefoot running. Tuttle also offers paid programs aimed giving personalized guide (I tried these). Another YouTube channel I've found helpful MovNat channel, barefoot-specific plenty good barefoot advice sprinkled throughout content. read Christopher McDougall, Born Run Natural Born Heroes fun barefoot-related reads. Indeed, Born Run arguably popularize barefoot running anything else since padded shoe born early 1970s.
also worth saying barefoot shoes zero-sum game. year wore barefoot shoes running, regular shoes tasks, sandals rest time. nothing. go barefoot run slap favorite Converse right after, that's OK. equally important know everyone different. took six months fully transition barefoot shoes. that's me. might take two months two years. Go pace, worry experiences others.
