Trek FX+ 2
prices direct-to-consumer bikes appealing, send kid hill skateboard wobbly wheels, recommend yourself. first bike, strongly suggest going established manufacturer large support network affiliated retailers shops, test assemble fix yourself. also suggest looking all-in-one package—lights bell non-negotiable purchases want ride night rain.
Almost every major bike manufacturer makes entry-level commuter electric bicycle. Right now, reasonably priced one Trek FX+ 2 (8/10, WIRED Recommends). comes two versions: step-over step-through. (I'm currently riding step-through.) 40 pounds, pretty light! rides lot like light, versatile hybrid rode college. Trek's proprietary 250-watt hub motor, 250-watt-hour battery, standard 9-speed Shimano shifters, fast road bike wheels, hydraulic disc brakes, well fun extra built-ins, like integrated lights, bell, rear rack, fenders, kickstand. all, shockingly affordable package everything need start 6-mile city commute.
★ Alternatives: tried almost entry-level cruisers. Specialized makes one that's pricier nicer low-maintenance internal gear hub belt drive, like Cannondale's version well. Momentum owned Giant, Voya E+ 3 ($2,000) equally light absolutely stunning person. smart shift system may little confusing new electric biking, base price include commuter extras.
Runner-Up
VanMoof's ebikes often touted best beginners, picked Cowboy 4 ST (8/10, WIRED Recommends) simple reason that, electric bike relies heavily app phone, come charger. Like VanMoof, 4 ST beautiful, low-maintenance, easy assemble box. However, stem built-in quad lock system wireless charging. buy compatible phone case (a negligible, slightly annoying, extra expense), using Google Maps get around town easy painless.
also use phone check battery level easily pop frame charging indoors. somewhat rare see features like carbon belt drive price, well lights turn automatically gets dark. minus side, rear hub motor power output 250 watts, might enough live hilly area. Also, unlock app. 4 ST optimized riders 5'6" taller, makes slightly big 5'2". also comes version high-top tube, appreciate ease step-through.
Best Utility Bike
many years, recommended Seattle's Rad Power Bikes reliable, heavier, great direct-to-consumer (DTC) bike people wanted option carry gear another passenger. However, recent lawsuits concerning safety reliability given pause. Rad Power new CEO, thinking new ebike, consider company better track record.
That'd Ride1Up Cafe Cruiser passenger kit (7/10, WIRED Recommends). bike price point going feel nice natural slightly expensive one—the Cruiser's Bafang motor louder assistance little less smooth predictable. passenger kit, rear rack rated 150 pounds, restricted carrying daintier loved ones. 5'2", also find smallest step-through frame large me. However, like Shimano shifters hydraulic brakes. Also, bike big not-so-smooth acceleration, probably want throttle maximum maneuverability.
★ Alternatives: Every DTC similar bike, similar price point, similar components. Aventon Level starts $1,499 problems it. people know one version another RadRunner ($1,449) experienced problems. ebikes, recommend letting charge overnight letting children ride unsupervised.
Best Affordable Ebike
Unless already ebike enthusiast, probably want one that's expensive, means close $1,000 possible. tough proposition want reliable motor frame buckle 15 mph. Propella's 7-speed (8/10, WIRED Recommends) best cheap bike we've tested. WIRED reviewer Parker Hall says trustworthy components like Samsung battery Shimano disc brakes, plus nifty accessories like cool suspension seat. ships directly you, handy like avoid bike shop. Propella updates bikes every months. Since direct-to-consumer bike, we're warning local shop might issues repairing it.
★ Alternatives: would like gears, Propella also recently launched 9SPro ($1,599). I've also tested like Aventon Soltera ($1,199), hides battery frame nice backlit display.
Best All-Around Bike
avid cyclist, probably already know n + 1 rule, n = number bikes already 1 number bikes (in words: Buy another bike). loved one wants break addictive bike-buying cycle one bike rule all, Specialized's Turbo Tero X (8/10, WIRED Recommends) might bike you. Specialized revamped iconic mountain bike electric ride go anywhere anything, long, stable frame; big mullet-style wheels; customized full suspension; straight handlebars; bevy necessary commuter accessories, like bike bell, lights, fenders, rack.
paper, 250-watt motor 730-watt/hour battery powerful long-lasting might expect. Specialized's Mission Control app 12-gear shifters let precisely customize much assistance need, factoring things like much battery want conserve target heart rate. display even shows battery optimized pedal fit cyclist's 80-100 revolutions per minute (rpm), opposed recreational 60 rpm. almost 58 pounds, though, bike lightweight. $4,500 price packs punch well.
Best Road Racers
recently reviewed bike comparable Greg LeMond's all-carbon-fiber electric bike series. Prolog (8/10, WIRED Recommends) insanely light frame, stunning matte paint job, fancy-schmancy custom-designed fenders. also reliable components made well-known manufacturers—a one-button Mahle drive system, Shimano gravel-specific gearing system, Panaracer gravel tires—that make durable, versatile, easy repair.
However, can't good conscience ignore reports exceptionally bad customer service company, includes sending defective bikes, returning calls emails, issuing refunds. may better luck getting hands Specialized's Turbo Vado SL (9/10, WIRED Recommends), cuts weight tiny proprietary motor battery hidden within bike's frame.
Best Cargo Ebike
tandem bike, person sits front steers called pilot, person back pedals called stoker. That's Xtracycle's longtail ebike gets name; person sitting back work (it's ebike!) Stoker accommodate two adults comfortably. course, adult pilot also carry couple wriggly kids, week's worth groceries, overnight camping gear, bags soil garden center. rear footrests expandable cargo nets encase back wheel come standard, trick bike options like padded rear set, handrails, panniers, front rack. versatility makes one better options people like use family ebike way school drop-offs.
Even fully weighed 400-pound limit two adults backpacks, Stoker feels safe stable, thanks 24-inch wheels provide low center gravity powerful Shimano EP8 mid-drive motor delivers tons torque 400 percent pedal assistance. 630-Wh battery goes 45 miles charge (or 60 miles ride conservatively), week two's worth rides people. know need taller 5 feet, 6 inches comfortably pilot Stoker. Shorter humans check Xtracycle Swoop ($4,999), motor battery, many configuration options, uses step-through frame smaller wheels. —Michael Calore
Best Cargo Ebike Families
R & Load used top pick bakfiets, Dutch-style front-box cargo bicycle. However, Urban Arrow Family (8/10, WIRED Recommends) cheaper—not little—and offers many features attracted Load, like comfort maneuverability. suspension, though, best smoother streets.
love Enviolo continuously variable shifters, allow downshift bike standstill. Rather wobbling terrifying children frantically downshift pedaling, use walk assistance push bike convenient spot, downshift standing still, pedal upward torque power level choice. system, I've beaten people uphill riding cargo bikes. Bosch Performance motor currently stock, version powerful Bosch Cargo Line motor available.
★ Alternative: feel obligated point bike use tote around family (and cargo Portland) Tern GSD S00 (8/10, WIRED Recommends). Bosch Cargo Line motor powerful enough speedily transport two kids school back every day, along backpacks, groceries, gear, small enough takes reasonable amount space garage. first rode one daughter 3, still ride 7.
Best Micro Ebike
next big trend electric bikes micro-mobility, refers tiny personal vehicles. Tiny bikes affordable, easier transport, easier store. like minianything, really, they're completely irresistible.
far, favorite micro bike JackRabbit (7/10, WIRED Recommends). weighs astonishingly light 23 pounds, simple assemble box, fold save even space. pedals, hit chin knees; instead, toggle thumb throttle accelerate. caveat tiny battery motor powerful. I'm 115 pounds, slamming throttle gets 10 mph. Also, range around 10 miles, much compared picks.
★ Alternative: want convenience mini bike without looking so, er, comical, check Propella Mini ($849) (7/10, WIRED Recommends). Propella subbed 20-inch wheels slightly smaller frame, feels less like regular bike fits easily back car.
Best Folding Ebike
WIRED reviews editor Julian Chokkattu called M-E1 “pretty darn close perfection” review (9/10, WIRED Recommends). Folding bikes great apartment dwellers, they're usually tiny. Julian 6'4" looks like happy clown valiantly pedals around them.
M-E1 full-size virtually indistinguishable non-folding bike. solid components reliable manufacturers, like Shimano mid-drive motor, comfortable seat, Shimano hydraulic disc brakes, bells whistles—integrated lights, fenders, removable battery, easy-to-read display. importantly, Julian says, ride around without dying embarrassment—always plus.
Affordable Folding Bike
WIRED reviews editor Julian Chokkattu sees Lectric bikes around New York City count. makes sense, since Lectric affordable direct-to-consumer folding ebikes around. latest update, Lectric XP 3.0 (7/10, WIRED Recommends), offers same—nice suspension, solid range, thick fat tires, whole suite solid commuter accessories.
However, still heavy awkward fold. Chokkattu also says charging port difficult access bike folded up. importantly, he's quality issues Lectric bikes (this one leaky front tire). However, price right. live apartment need carry bike upstairs, might right pick you.
Best Mountain Ebike
tension presence electric bikes trails. Still, love sport getting older, e-MTB best way keep love. WIRED reviewer Stephanie Pearson loved Canyon's Spectral:On CFR (9/10, WIRED Recommends).
Spectral:On CFR playful ride, larger 29-inch front wheel smaller 27.5-inch back wheel full-carbon frame front rear suspension. pick 720- 900-watt-hour battery (the small frame size comes 720); 720-Wh battery quoted range 51 miles. Pearson fast, powerful, joyful 15- 25-mile rides singletrack left battery half-empty. always, sure test new electric mountain bike make sure know feels like try electric assist terrain super gnarly.
★ Alternative: seriously considering buying Trek Fuel EXe ($9,200). Trek's adaptive assistance quiet perfectly calibrated; motor quiet battery invisible. climbed, looked felt like … little bit shape actually am. perfect bike want buzz cross-country trails, need little assistance get top without falling down.
Best Mobility Concerns
Electric bikes inclusive. Even older fit used be, still hop electric bike ride miles. Tern's NBD (6/10, WIRED Review) designed specifically people mobility issues. frame lowest step-through I've ever seen. top tube mere 15 inches ground—you barely lift leg bestride bike.
bunch low-maintenance ergonomic features, Tern's maintenance-free Gates drive internal hub motor, huge handles, big, flat foot pedals, suspended seat, big, bright Bosch display buttons identify touch. Bosch Performance Line motor provides 65-Nm torque, long-lived battery went one bar 18 miles. slightly 51 pounds, also relatively light. yes, pretty spendy need extra-low inches. do, hard put price able ride again.
★ Alternative: Still want light, convenient Tern want spend quite much? Quick Haul ($2,999) equally small light offers slightly sportier ride, much affordable.
Gocycle G4I+ $6,999: Gocycle's high-end, fast-folding luxury bikes designed former McLaren engineer. quieter, lighter iteration better torque, new carbon-fiber front fork, even painful price.
Electric Bikes Dislike
love try new bikes. Unfortunately, bikes always like us.
Civilized Cycle ($6,950): bike carry full-grown person back good option people want Vespa-like style without get scooter license (7/10, WIRED Review). However, fit anyone shorter 5'10". Ooohkay.
Advice Consider
seen bikes around neighborhood. look like much fun! want one! ebikes many different specs price points. Here's would consider, position.
build bike?
Many affordable bikes come direct-to-consumer—meaning pre-tuned partially assembled box. Peter Flax recently noted Bicycling magazine, bikes get nearly testing vetting bikes bigger manufacturer get. Unless riding much many miles, experienced modifying bike, recommend working established manufacturer dealer network.
bikes cost more?
higher-end components. Batteries motors high-end brands like Bosch Shimano often powerful cover distance, 90- 120-mile range, compared 15-20 mile ranges see affordable bikes. However, may matter short commute.
terrain live on?
live flat area, probably fine 250-watt motor, European speed standard. However, live near hills haul lot stuff, might want consider 500-watt 750-watt motor extras, like hydraulic disc brakes, help prevent skidding traffic.
would also look mid-drive motor instead hub-drive motor. Mid-drive motors located center bike feel natural. hub drive rear axle shifts center gravity backward, takes getting used to. throw balance going steep hills.
Follow basic safety tips.
big batteries motors. leave bike battery charging overnight, let children ride bike unsupervised. 80-pound child piloting 65-pound bike, even motor makes possible so.
