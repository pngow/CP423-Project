bot accessible via web page separate Google’s regular search interface. offer three answers query—a design choice meant impress upon users Bard generating answers fly may sometimes make mistakes.
Google also offer recommended query conventional web search beneath Bard response. possible users give feedback answers help Google refine bot clicking thumbs-up thumbs-down, option type detailed feedback.
Google says early users Bard found useful aid generating ideas text. Collins also acknowledges successfully got misbehave, although specify exactly restrictions Google tried place bot.
Bard ChatGPT show enormous potential flexibility also unpredictable still early stage development. presents conundrum companies hoping gain edge advancing harnessing technology. company like Google large established products, challenge particularly difficult.
chatbots use powerful AI models predict words follow given sentence based statistical patterns gleaned enormous amounts text training data. turns incredibly effective way mimicking human responses questions, means algorithms sometimes make up, “hallucinate,” facts—a serious problem bot supposed helping users find information search web.
ChatGPT-style bots also regurgitate biases language found darker corners training data, example around race, gender, age. also tend reflect back way user addresses them, causing readily act emotions vulnerable nudged saying strange inappropriate things.
Google AI researchers invented several key innovations went creation ChatGPT. include type machine-learning algorithm, known transformer, used build language model behind ChatGPT.
Collins Google says one reason company launching Bard now, bot far perfect, valuable data generated people interact system. OpenAI Microsoft already streaming launches. “Human feedback really important part we're launching Bard,” Collins says. “We want broaden [it] beyond we've gotten internally.”
“Google’s core existence threatened Microsoft,” says Aravind Srinivas, cofounder CEO Perplexity AI, search startup using technology like work ChatGPT Bard.
Perplexity’s product chat-style interface, design choice aimed avoiding giving users feeling dialog another intelligent being. Srinivas says giving Bard capacity speak like person “risky,” may mislead confuse users.
expects tools like Bard improve dramatically coming years, says Google gambling won’t suffer reputational damage short term Bard gets things wrong. “People may longer take granted Google always right,” says. “It’s tricky them.”
