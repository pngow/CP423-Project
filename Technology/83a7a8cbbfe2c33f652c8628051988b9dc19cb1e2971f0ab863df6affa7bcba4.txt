TikTok Hearing Revealed Congress Problem
one sense, today’s US congressional hearing TikTok big success: revealed, five hours, desperately United States needs national data-privacy protections—and lawmakers believe, somehow, taking swipes China suitable alternative.
some, job Thursday casting hearing's witness, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew, stand-in Chinese government—in cases, communism itself—and belting like side beef. questions lawmakers put Chew vague, speculative, immaterial allegations company. members Congress asking questions feigned little interest Chew’s responses anyway.
Attempts Chew, 40-year-old former Goldman Sachs banker, elaborate TikTok’s business practices frequently interrupted, requests remark matters supposedly considerable interest members Congress blocked occasionally ignored. opportunities get CEO record, oath, repeatedly blown name expediency mostly theatrical reasons. Chew, contrast, portrait patience, even talked over. Even lawmakers began asking and, without pause, answering questions.
hearing might’ve flop, lawmakers planned dig new dirt TikTok, owned China-based ByteDance, even hash company could next allay concerns. aim. House Energy Commerce Committee gathered, said, investigate “how Congress safeguard American data privacy protect children online harms.” that, hearing revealed plenty.
one thing, it’s clear attempts isolate TikTok competitors—to treat differently dozens companies atrocious records endangering kids abusing private data—is pointless exercise. Asking TikTok's propensity surveilling users, Chicago congresswoman Jan Schakowsky warned Chew using legal, typical industry practices defense wrongs. “You might say, ‘not companies,’” said, adding preferred “go standard.”
OK. not?
truth TikTok vanish tomorrow, users would simply flock number apps qualms surveilling private moments lives amassing, manipulating, selling sensitive information them. Excluding serious largely unsubstantiated allegations leveled TikTok—that acting act coordination Chinese intelligence services—there wasn’t concern privacy raised lawmakers Thursday addressed existing legislation supporting national privacy law.
Ensuring companies data brokers enrich face swift reprisals blatantly abusing user trust would benefit addressing accusations levied TikTok, deceitful practices common across entire social media industry.
irony US lawmakers pursuing solution problem that’s already solved draft legislation—but actually fixed due inaction—wasn’t entirely lost members. primarily focused single company, hearing, Florida congresswoman Kathy Castor said, really serve broader call action. “From surveillance, tracking, personal data gathering, addictive algorithmic operations serve harmful content corrosive effect kids’ mental physical well-being,” said, Americans deserve protection, matter source.
issue, Castor added, goes far beyond TikTok China. “There malign actors across world gather data, use element social control, influence peddling, worse,” said. “Big Tech platforms profit immensely keeping children addicted … modern-day tobacco cigarette companies.”
conflation data privacy concerns—that is, surveillant threat posed Beijing—and ways TikTok fails underaged users theme throughout hearing, topics puzzlingly discussed interchangeably. reality, content moderation privacy different problems, unified solution. Passing national privacy law limits data companies collect would, fact, prove small feat compared navigating legal minefield around content moderation enforcement—a path fraught First Amendment peril. even within Congress' power legislate kids away online harm, would limit scope remedy single company?
Congress handed ample opportunity address concerns children's minds warped social media year ago. Facebook caught creepily referring preteen kids source “untapped” wealth, Congress, response, nothing.
Last week, Senate lawmakers introduced bill authorizing sweeping new executive powers, including ability force TikTok sell US operations face outright ban. law would stop there. could applied potentially foreign company product, powerful tool future administration devices. golden use-case scenario, US intelligence community would declassify wealth information help convince Americans world necessity action. even bill’s authors recognize may always liberty so.
Chinese law, domestic companies “are ultimately required bidding Chinese intelligence services, called upon so,” one bill’s authors, Mark Warner, told WIRED. Senate intelligence veteran added nothing he'd heard TikTok CEO today anything assuage concerns.
