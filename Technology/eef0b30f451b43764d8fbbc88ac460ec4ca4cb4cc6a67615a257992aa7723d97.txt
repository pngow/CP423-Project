Writer Sara Petersen one foremost chroniclers world online moms. publishes lively newsletter topic, “In Pursuit Clean Countertops,” released first book, Momfluenced: Inside Maddening, Picture-Perfect World Mommy Influencer Culture, takes broader look phenomenon. Momfluenced includes interviews mix influencers audience members, well Petersen’s personal reflections remains enthralled subculture.
Petersen insightful she’s dissecting people drawn mom internet. “We perform mothering online way accessing meaning when, days, work motherhood doesn’t seem mean much anything according many men legislating paid family leave, universal preschool, childcare subsidies,” writes. sharing images stories lives, momfluencers create narratives, rendering private sometimes invisible-feeling experience visible wider audience. “Motherhood renders mothers powerless extent, momfluencer culture offers us power control.”
One influencer tells Petersen value posting parenthood online lies “the knowledge we’re alone—that matter experience, matter challenging rare is, chances there’s someone else relate, empathize, awareness whose existence provides comfort.” People want validation. especially want validation vulnerable moments. mother endlessly vulnerable, validation dearly won.
Momfluenced generous book. Petersen evaluates women operate, treads gently. She’s harder affluent, cisgendered, white internet moms, views “cringe follows” (they’re unbearably corny and/or bad politics) others sell unattainable lifestyle, robust fiddle-leaf figs growing plastic-free playrooms tastefully decorated shades ecru ochre. But, overall, less concerned critiquing women peddle idealized vision motherhood trying understand badly wants buy they’re selling.
Although includes “maddening” subtitle, Momfluenced firmly sympathetic influencers studies. Toward end book, remove ambiguity, Petersen explicitly clarifies “take issue” profession momfluencing.

Momfluenced, Petersen discusses influencer named Katy Rose Pritchard “has forced reevaluate Instagram platform usage thanks stranger stealing photos children use ‘role play.’” anecdote touches momfluencers beginning reckon ethics commercializing kids. Petersen writes Pritchard spent weeks “painstakingly removing photos kids Instagram feed, well posts she’d tagged.”
Sounds good, right? prudent response horrifying incident, one underlines vulnerable make children pushing images world. Only, go Pritchard’s social accounts website right now, appears didn’t end following removing pictures kids. images remain prominently featured content, including recent posts.
another story touching ethics posting images children, Petersen talks Erica Nolan, trans mom Portland, Oregon. “While Erica make daughter focus account, makes point post photos every then, sticker daughter’s face, normalize identity trans mom,” Petersen writes.
Again: Sounds good. went Nolan’s Instagram page look she’d redacted daughter, noticed account really didn’t resemble influencer. last 27 posts selfies. 40 posts deep, there’s one shot kid face blurred out. returns face. None posts sponsored. seems stretch call Nolan momfluencer account clearly devoted self-portraiture. approach showing child online doesn’t really speak behavior women focus mom content monetize domestic lives.
Meanwhile, momfluencers Petersen interviewed—she provides Instagram handles, look up, did—regularly blast children’s images public accounts tens hundreds thousands followers, often direct intention commercializing family unit.
decision use children props public performance motherhood might undertaken several understandable reasons. might look like viable money-making option stay-at-home parent, example. beloved neonatal nurse created little media empire part showcasing raising children, going detail different temperaments youngest’s struggles tongue ties. type sharing genuinely helpful—but mean it’s critique. it’s somehow anti-feminist anti-mother acknowledge momfluencer content rotten deal kids, even moms like it.
decades, suspect we’ll look casually sharing kid’s face personal milestones open internet horror reserve moms smoke cigarettes pregnancy drive babies laps. We’re already seeing first wave momfluencer children fight back, asking legal protections sorely lack. addition exposing obvious hazards (pedophiles, stalkers), turning children content public consumption insidious side effect. Even everything goes right, robs something able give up: privacy.

Somebody angry something I’d tweeted created Instagram account devoted threatening son’s life. reposted photos menacing messages repeat forever burned brain. days frantically reporting account, deleted. left rattled risks exposing young children strangers internet.
wasn’t trying hurt child putting image online. momfluencers share photos videos children surely good intentions, whether simply want show cute kid also want monetize cute kid part burgeoning brand image order provide better life financial stability. Everyone trying best, on. Still. I’m responsible dissemination kid’s image, mothers likewise responsible theirs. hook here, shouldn’t let off.
look, phones aren’t going anywhere. People going take photos kids show friends post social media. That’s fine. like seeing photos friends’ kids. (And still post photos kid locked, friends-only Instagram account.) deliberately turn kid content, take images stories sell wider public’s consumption—it’s mistake.
