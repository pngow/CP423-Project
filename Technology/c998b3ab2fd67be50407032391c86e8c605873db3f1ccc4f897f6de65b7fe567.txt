AirTags Perfectly Boring, Functional Future AR
Apple’s AirTags found way market. long-rumored competitor Tile—a tiny Bluetooth tag attach frequently lost items—was unveiled today Apple’s spring hardware announcement.
event included everything newly redesigned iMacs overpowered iPads, though new AirTags diminutive new gadgets, become part vast network nearly billion wirelessly connected Apple devices—and non-Apple devices, since AirTags attached pretty much physical object. introductory video product, Apple Man (typically white, slightly disheveled, on-the-go kinda guy) couch dives lost keys. eventually finds them, thought attach AirTag keys, iPhone pinpointed exactly are.
scenario somewhat possible launch AirTags, using Bluetooth. Apple touting precision AirTags, use special chip aid location, also said AirTags support visual audible cues.
latter feature points another emerging platform Apple: augmented reality. company didn’t explicitly say AirTags used AR apps, immersive computing experts point AirTags technology using ARKit, Apple’s software framework AR, tying digital information nearby physical objects important step evolution tech.
Location, Location, Location

AirTag around size quarter attached devices using kind keychain accessory. (Oddly, they’re adhesive; again, Apple loves sell overpriced accessories.) rely existing “Find My” network, launched public 2019 utilizes Bluetooth technology let connect nearby strangers iPhone iPad order recover lost items. resulting system giant, anonymous, end-to-end encrypted network. Almost current Apple products compatible Find My.
many ways similar Tile works—with device running Tile app serving possible scout everyone else’s lost Tiles—and Tile nearly decade-long headstart Apple this. Founded Nick Evans Mike Farley back 2012, Tile took early advantage low-energy Bluetooth make widgets boasted year-long battery life weren’t hideous leave hanging keychain pet collar. long within 150 feet tagged object, could tell Tile app you’d misplaced something hear unmissable beep coming Tile. (Even Al Roker Tile fan.)
huge part Apple’s strategy try dominate personal computing market control nearly every element hardware software stack, recent years packed products custom Apple-designed silicon. AirTags exception: one includes relatively new ultra-wideband location chip, Apple named U1, AirTag functions extension Apple’s existing Find network. user iPhone 11 later (the iPhones matching ultra-wideband capability) lose AirTag, phone’s accelerometer, camera, gyroscope also tapped direct person lost object much precision offering on-screen arrows visual cues point way. Think way: lost object goes “somewhere first floor house” “underneath third couch cushion.”
AirTags cost $29 apiece; Tiles start $20. AirTags announcement also comes day Tile's general counsel set testify front US Senate Judiciary Committee’s subcommittee Competition Policy, Antitrust, Consumer Rights, company plans argue Apple unfairly elbowing Tile’s market.
Hidden World

kind precision tracking explicitly useful case lost items, like jacket wallet (or dog, hopefully dog). computer vision immersive computing experts say could another stroke broader picture Apple’s AR strategy, even AR strategy still abstract right now.
“Sure, products help find keys again, that’s exciting part,” says Gordon Wetzstein, leads Computational Imaging Lab Stanford University. “For spatial computing application, physical object becomes part digital environment, precisely locating first critical part it.”
Wetzstein sees AirTags part potential “hidden digital layer” exists nearby physical environment, like Harry Potter game “magically exists everywhere, even don’t see naked eyes hold device unveil secret game stations.” Or, go back practical application: Instead seeing flat, 2D image iPhone keys buried couch, virtual arrow would layered top view phone’s camera, guiding exact location keys move closer.
Many iPhone owners already used AR Apple handset, even haven’t realized it. One useful AR tools built iPhone simplest, virtual tape measure Measure app—helpful want figure wide new bed size frame need hang photo wall. five years ago Niantic Labs’ Pokémon Go became viral AR sensation, millions people experiencing physical world phone screens hunted virtual game characters.

difference AR games like Pokémon Go, Wetzstein says, still primarily reliant phone’s Wi-Fi GPS radios determine location, sensors cannot provide nearly precise location information ultra-wideband tech. Something low-cost low-power like AirTag, Wetzstein says, seems like “the perfect choice” enabling apps depend precise tracking.
Jessica Brillhart, runs mixed reality lab USC’s Institute Creative Technologies, points location tags could also way sharing two-way information objects within space. Attach one tags object, assign name, “the system learn scale constitutes fridge, constitutes bridge, constitutes tree,” Brillhart says. “So it’s access point, works tandem, feeding information system helping people contextualize world.”
It’s worth noting Apple hasn’t identified specific use case AirTags, fact cannot ignored network location-aware devices exists world, network could provide knowledge necessary unlock powerful applications.
“The biggest hurdle AR really knowing you’re looking knowing are, AirTags may help contribute understanding,” Brillhart says.
Apple yet responded requests comment story. Apple’s AR ambitions likely don’t end AirTags, Measure app, flashy games. company reportedly working AR glasses—as Facebook, Snap, others—though recent reports suggest Apple’s first heads-up display may niche device consumer-friendly product.
even Apple AR glasses arrive become success, even AR games like Pokémon Go emerge steal hearts children adults, iPhone owners continue experience AR mundane, ultimately useful, ways. Whether they’re using iPhone measure filing cabinet home office, following onscreen arrows find AirTagged backpack rushing school, they’re plugged Apple’s vision augmented reality. glasses required.
