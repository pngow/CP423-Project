Online Sleuths Untangle Mystery Nord Stream Sabotage
It’s six months since Nord Stream gas pipelines ruptured series explosions, leaking tons methane environment igniting international whodunit. Russia, United States, United Kingdom, unnamed pro-Ukrainian group accused planting explosives Baltic Sea pipelines recent months. half year since sabotage took place, mystery remains unsolved.
Digital sleuths stepping help provide clarity around bombshell claims behind attacks. Open source intelligence (OSINT) researchers using public sources data efforts verify debunk snippets information published Nord Stream explosions. They’re providing glimpse clarity incident that’s shrouded secrecy international politics.
Since early February, multiple media reports claimed provide new information could attacked Nord Stream 1 2 pipelines September 26. However, reports largely based anonymous sources, including unnamed intelligence officials leaks government investigations attacks.
First, American investigative journalist Seymour Hersh published claims US behind attacks post Substack. followed reports New York Times German publication Die Zeit claiming pro-Ukrainian group responsible. (European leaders previously speculated Russia could behind attacks, Russia blamed United Kingdom.) country claimed responsibility blasts far, official investigations ongoing.
recent reports provided little hard evidence show may actually happened, helping fuel speculation. Jacob Kaarsbo, senior analyst Think Tank Europa, previously worked Danish intelligence 15 years, says claims “remarkable” also “speculative” nature. “In mind, don’t really alter picture,” Kaarsbo says, adding attacks look highly complex would likely “very hard pull without state actor least state sponsorship.”
absence official information, OSINT researchers trying plug gaps examining claims new reports public data. OSINT analysis powerful way determine event may unfolded. instance, flight- ship-tracking data reveal movements around world, satellite images show Earth near real-time, small clues backgrounds photos videos reveal taken. techniques uncovered Russian assassins, spotted North Korea evading international trading sanctions, identified potential war criminals, documented pollution.
Nord Stream blasts, little OSINT available. Researchers identified “dark ships” area. underwater, obviously limited data sources tapped into—cameras sensors don’t monitor every inch pipelines. “OSINT probably won’t break case open, used verify strengthen hypotheses,” says Oliver Alexander, analyst focuses OSINT closely looking Nord Stream blasts. “I think it’s verification tool.”
Alexander others examining claims made far. New York Times Die Zeit published stories March 7 claiming Ukrainian group behind sabotage. (Ukraine denied involvement.) Die Zeit published details, claiming German investigators searched yacht rented company based Poland, knew yacht sailed from, six people involved operation, including two divers. used forged passports, publication reported.
details enough OSINT researchers start tracking yacht could used. Alexander, well contributors open-source investigative outlet Bellingcat, started following breadcrumbs, narrowing potential vessels. follow-up report soon named boat suspicion Andromeda, 15-meter-long yacht. Webcam footage harbor believed Andromeda docked shows movement boat around time reported publications. (The Andromeda reportedly small required use ship-tracking systems.) Years-old videosand photos boat surfaced. sleuthing adds public details reports.
Similarly, OSINT used debunk Hersh’s story claiming United States behind explosions. (Hersh defended article, US officials said false.) Alexander used, among things, ship-tracking data show Norwegian ships “accounted for” “position placed explosives Nord Stream pipeline, claimed Hersh.” Another detailed article Norwegian journalists similarly poured cold water Hersh’s claims, partly using satellite data.
sabotage always likely controversial surrounded rumors: Russia’s full-scale invasion Ukraine February 2022 heated global tensions put pressure diplomats around world. whirlwind disinformation around blasts, muddying waters. Mary Blankenship, disinformation researcher University Nevada, Las Vegas, analyzed online conversations around war, says “high uncertainty high stakes” incident help fuel spread disinformation.
“This issue exploits existing worries, tensions, grievances within European audiences,” Blankenship says. Initially, earliest disinformation Twitter explosions came conspiracy theorists, Blankenship says, shared pre-war statement US president Joe Biden, said would “end” Nord Stream 2 Russia invaded Ukraine. Since then, Russia China taken sharing unproven theories sabotage, researcher says.
“Disinformation actors, also official representatives [Russian] regime, stepped efforts every news story published this—however contradictory origins blast—be blog post Seymour Hersh New York Times article,” says Peter Stano, EU spokesperson, adding disinformation narratives circled around idea “the US blame.” EU’s disinformation monitoring project, EUvsDisinfo, flagged 150 pieces disinformation linked Nord Stream explosions, including building Hersh’s story. “EUvsDisinfo experts also found Moscow considers recent materials German-language media hoax,” Stano says.
OSINT helping provide bits extra detail claims Nord Stream attacks, likely reports debunking dubious claims reach fewer people disinformation claims hard verify. “It nearly get level engagement,” Blankenship says. “You book’s worth evidence it, would still find way discount it.”
OSINT research answer questions, limits also raise new ones. Kaarsbo, former Danish intelligence official, experts pointed Andromeda relatively small yacht, may unable carry amount explosives needed blow pipelines. “The Andromeda quite likely piece puzzle, don’t think it’s bigger piece puzzle everyone makes be,” Alexander says. “I think lot big pieces missing.” Detailed sonar imagery damaged pipes would help people understand happened underwater, Alexander adds.
Ultimately, still little hard public evidence—either governments publicly available online—about may behind attacks. Behind closed doors, intelligence agencies likely data theories potential culprits. However, investigators Sweden Denmark refused comment progress, Germany’s Office Federal Prosecutor confirmed searched yacht continuing examine explosives. German officials also said could chance “false flag” operation smear Ukraine. countries complete investigations, there’s guarantee publish findings evidence back up. mystery continues.
