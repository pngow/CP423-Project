Best All-Around
Fitbit Charge 5
Even Fitbit faced stiff competition manufacturers—most notably, Apple Watch—its trackers always over. hit specific sweet spot attractiveness, affordability, accessibility, ease use. They're perfect everyone ultra-marathoner semipro powerlifter trying hit PR.
Charge line consistently reached top rankings, Charge 5 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) exception. Last year's iteration introduced softer lines, bright AMOLED screen, almost every sensor could want, stress scans electrocardiograms. Like Apple Watch iPhones, Charge 5 fast-pairs Android phones onboard connected GPS track outdoor workouts without hitch. also FDA-cleared feature detect atrial fibrillation, via Fitbit's new Heart Rhythm Notifications feature. major downside still pay $10 per month, $80 per year, Fitbit Premium subscription access Fitbit's best features. Fitbit also owned Google, might deter you. all, hardware still less expensive easier use others list.
Runner-Up
One biggest pain points fitness trackers proprietary charger. used convenience charging phone earbuds all-purpose Qi wireless charging pads, hunting proprietary charger real annoyance. Vivomove Trend (8/10, WIRED Recommends) first Garmin wireless charging, works!
Like 2022's Vivomove Sport ($180), analog watch face connected GPS via watch. Start activity swiping tapping analog watch face waiting Garmin's startlingly accurate Move IQ pick up. get access Garmin's convenient fitness features, like incident detection, contactless payments, sleep tracking, continuous heart rate monitoring. Garmin also helpful comprehensive fitness algorithms available—I've always found Body Battery metric startlingly accurate, even catching I'm getting sick getting PMS.
downside Vivomove Sport much cheaper looks almost same. probably make difference six months replace chargers.
Best iPhone
People tend hold Apple Watches years, rightfully so—it far away best fitness tracker iPhone. want one, best latest Series 8 (8/10, WIRED Recommends). comes new body temperature sensors aimed tracking menstrual cycles. also new safety features, Crash Detection. event severe car accident, Series 8 use powerful new accelerometer gyroscope well barometer, GPS, microphone detect car crash alert emergency services user responded within 10 seconds.
come conjunction whole host health fitness features WatchOS 9, better workout views, in-depth running metrics, medication logging, better sleep tracking. comparison, new Apple Watch SE latest S8 chip Crash Detection, wrist-based body temperature sensing, well older features like blood oxygen ECG app. exception Fitbit, widest array third-party accessories.
Best Budget Tracker
want simple health tracker track steps sleep let know someone calling, internet's marketplace awash knockoffs fitness tracker. $80, might well get original instead. year, Fitbit released latest version hugely popular Inspire, thankfully (in opinion) use Wear OS. Instead, continues use Fitbit's clear easy Fitbit app, pedometer tracks SpO2 sleep, comes wide array watch faces accessories.
easy-peasy. connectivity issues restart phone Inspire 3 update time zone day two. Inspire 3 also regularly overestimated much sleep I'd gotten, made mistrust new Sleep Profile feature. two months, chronic nighttime cough; Inspire 3 regularly logged 7 hours night lying still, switching sensitive fitness tracker put much accurate 5. However, health issues, reliable accessible knockoff Inspire 3, Fitbit also regularly puts trackers sale.
★ Alternative: also tried Amazon's Halo View ($35), works Alexa uses Amazon's Activity Points system. However, blow Activity Points metric water running, biking kids school walking dog, find particularly useful find constant pushing partnerships Whole Foods WW (formerly known Weight Watchers) stressful.
Best Running Watch
Garmin's Forerunner line long best GPS-enabled fitness tracker runners, midrange Forerunner 255 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) offers incredible value number features offers Garmin's lineup.
want feature? probably it, like multiband GPS support barometric altimeter, compass, improved sleep tracking, Bluetooth compatibility number heart rate monitors. battery life incredible—reviewer Scott Gilbertson estimates 30 hours continuous use—and extend battery life even turning features like continuous Pulse Ox measuring. especially liked new Morning Report, includes Body Battery well daily greeting, weather, tidbits, much like Apple offers.
also worth noting Forerunner line quite extensive meets variety needs. beginning runner triathlete probably happy cheaper basic Forerunner 35 ($170), experienced triathlete want Forerunner 945 ($600). Older models also retain value go sale time.
Best Android Owners
Samsung's new Galaxy Watch5 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) comfiest Wear OS smartwatch there. comes 40- 44-mm sizes runs latest version Wear OS 3, meaning get access Google Maps' turn-by-turn navigation Google Assistant, plus best Samsung's health features, including SpO2 measurements, auto-workout detection, sleep tracking, electrocardiogram. great checking notifications responding them, too.
Like Apple Watch, expect go days single charge. WIRED reviews editor Julian Chokkattu says usually charge day half. Unfortunately, watch works Android phones, ECG tracking limited Samsung phones (as blood pressure monitoring, that's available US yet anyway). want bigger watch that's bit rugged, try pricey Galaxy Watch5 Pro ($500), better battery life, GPX support, made durable materials. Alternatively, want save cash, snag last year's Galaxy Watch4, still great watch.
Best Wear OS
Apple honing smartwatch fitness tracker finely tuned machine, Google noticeably late party. finally debuted year, reviews editor Julian Chokkattu noted include key fitness features like ECG heart rate monitor, auto workout detection, fall detection, SpO2 sensing. Fitbit integration smooth might think, given Google acquired company 2019—the app looks dated cramped screen, Wear OS needs apps general.
However, Pixel notably beautiful watch heart fitness tracking experience Fitbit's, means data accurate empowering (you still pay Fitbit Premium subscription). Also, features unrolling 2023. waiting bated breath Wear OS watch, might it.
Best Ring
complaints Oura's Gen3 ring—namely, company strongly encouraging customers commit upgrade Gen3 new $6-per-month subscription long newest features even available.
However, sea identical square round watches, really tracker like Oura. extremely small attractive, year's new onboard sensors accurate before. features available membership, access guided meditations, personalized insights, educational content; without it, able access three basic Oura scores, Daily Readiness, Sleep, Activity scores (essentially saw last year). trouble predicting period, ring sensitive enough pick half-degree temperature drop right mine starts. Although company made explicit statement Roe v. Wade, it’s based Finland abides GDPR, US-based health authorities cannot subpoena data it.
Wearable
biggest problem fitness wearable kind often get way … working fitness. can't wear Oura ring rock climbing, example. That's cult fitness tracker company Whoop introduced line smart clothes year. Right now, I'm wearing tracker tucked Any-Wear bralette. can't even feel it! track runs Garmin!
Whoop best suited athletes independently interpret somewhat arcane metrics. “Daily Strain” measures cardiovascular load, day walked 3 miles fro supposedly harder day lifted weights hour. Whoop 4.0 also smaller last year's model, new battery, experience charging issues new version. keep app running times, lest constantly warn can't update right second. $30, monthly subscription expensive one here, line proprietary clothing extended sizing. Even caveats, wearable I've ever forgotten I'm wearing.
Best Outdoor Watch
year, Garmin released two high-end adventure watches: Epix ($1,000) year's update Fenix series, Fenix 7S Sapphire Solar (8/10, WIRED Recommends). Epix 47-mm case large, brilliant AMOLED screen; Fenix memory-in-pixel (MIP) display. However, Epix's case huge, display eats lot battery. I'd go Fenix instead.
year's iteration vastly improved battery life solar charging—I got two weeks one charge, intermittent sunlight cloudy Oregon winter. Multiple GPS systems meant pinpointed location incredible speed accuracy, even rain tree cover. record every biometric every sport sun. honestly, maps MIP still look detailed pretty great. downside? still fairly spendy, earlier iterations go sale pretty often.
★ Alternative: super bright, super crisp display super easy-to-use app top list priorities, highly recommend Coros Apex 2 Pro. connects five satellite systems includes dual-frequency GNSS support Apple Watch Ultra has, precise (and fast!) location tracking. regular use, battery lasted month.
tracking accurate Apple Watch Ultra's, Coros' training plans metrics proprietary training system, EvoLab, detailed helpful Garmin's. plans also clearly aimed experienced runners, although beginners. also like big grooved buttons, fact screen locks, startlingly wide variety watch faces.
Best Weekend Warriors
year, Apple introduced completely new type Apple Watch: Ultra (8/10, WIRED Recommends), rugged sports watch intended endurance athletes. 2.5-day battery life seems mediocre, secret runners, cyclists, skiers admit: us Jenny Graham. us happy enjoy day coming home pork shoulder roast shower.
Iif iPhone access outlet, Apple Watch Ultra best outdoor watch you. certified MIL-STD-810H standard military equipment, die gets hot, cold, dusty. made aerospace-grade titanium flat sapphire crystal display, host specialized navigation features, like new hybrid analog-digital compass; Backtrack, find way back trail become disoriented; Waypoints, track points interest. precision dual-frequency GPS system ensure running stats accurate crowded city marathon, three built-in microphones special wind-reduction algorithms take work calls top lift.
Best Analog Watch Dupe
Withings ScanWatch (8/10, WIRED Recommends) unique several reasons. Many trackers, Apple Watch Series 8, offer ability detect atrial fibrillation measure blood oxygen levels SpO2 sensor. However, Withings obtained clearance US Food Drug Administration selling ScanWatch US. trackers list go several days without charging, ScanWatch go month. access features Health Mate app without subscription.
worth pointing fitness trackers look like fitness trackers, ScanWatch looks like normal analog watch. best everyday fitness tracker anyone want broadcast world count many hours sleep night. WIRED contributor Simon Hill gives highest praise possible—even nine months, he's still wearing it.
Favorite Watch
watches, one chose come two-week beach adventure vacation Instinct 2 Solar (9/10, WIRED Recommends). one Garmin's popular backcountry watches combines somewhat chunky, technical aesthetic (and fun colors!) backcountry capability. Instinct 2, get access Garmin's multiple satellite systems navigational features, insane battery life, ability track many sport-specific metrics … without blowing money extras like big light-up screen.
main updates Instinct 2 improved solar charging, high-resolution display, petite 40-mm case size. smaller size fits wrist jacket sleeve much easily, high-resolution display easier read. battery also lasted mindblowing 21 days, multiple tracked activities per day. also comes ton different colors sports-specific styles. example, popular Surf Edition—there also Tactical Esports versions—is compatible hugely popular surf forecasting company Surfline. see tide data track surfing. (It also best colors.)
★ Alternative: Can't decide Instinct Vivomove lines? to. I'm currently testing Instinct Crossover Solar ($500), combines Instinct's rugged capabilities Garmin's solar-powered watch face. little less intuitive operate either Instinct Vivomove itself, find analog hands convenient battery life stellar.
Honorable Mentions
liked watches quite make top picks.
Mobvoi TicWatch GTH Pro $100: Mobvoi's TicWatch Pro 3 Ultra GPS one colleague Julian Chokkattu's top smartwatch picks. That's Wear OS watch though, GTH Pro smart. standout feature Arty, uses two light sensors monitor heart health. However, Withings watch cleared FDA, far GTH Pro not. screen also fritzes occasionally.
Amazfit GTR 3 Pro $230: first Amazfit's watches I've actually liked wearing. onboard GPS sturdy durable, screen beautiful. However, reliably get Bluetooth notifications, measure blood oxygen levels control music, advanced training metrics need ironing out.
Polar Ignite $202: like Ignite's low profile extremely granular data collection, lets check factors like heart-rate variability, breathing rate, heart rate combine ramp autonomic nervous system.
Suunto 9 Peak $575: recommended Suunto 9 Baro bikepacking, 9 Peak includes features much compact, attractive package. sensitive great everyday tracker (it tells I've hit 400 steps even get bed), great adventure watch.
Buyer Beware
Fossil Gen 6 Wellness $299: unhappy reviews editor Julian Chokkattu said smartwatch laggy barebones fitness tracking, ECG. pretty attractive, though.
Amazfit PowerBuds Pro $120: concept earbuds also fitness trackers intriguing, look feel lot like AirPods Pro. However, particularly like Zepp OS, utility also limited since wear earbuds constantly (at least, don't).
Matrix PowerWatch 2 $300: Recharging solar energy body heat works! wore watch three weeks without recharge it. However, huge clunky. testing, heart rate monitor inaccurate, hard change display. app also beset technical problems, constantly reinstall app reconnect watch.
