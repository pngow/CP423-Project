news reports often get people angry, wow, people get mad article published last summer BMW. described German automaker sold features vehicles subscriptions, including offering South Korea charged $18 things drivers accustomed coming standard, heated seats.
Subscription-weary consumers reacted outrage. Spotify, Netflix, razors, coffee: come monthly fees. asked subscribe heated seats seemed point something broken core money-for-stuff compact global capitalism. car company could give take away access tuchus warmers press button faraway Germany, mean “own” anything?
BMW North America eventually put statement saying would always allow customers buy features permanently front vehicle. also defended offering subscriptions features dashcams remote start functions provide “flexibility.” furor died down, furors do.
many ways, BMW heated-seat kerfuffle early skirmish larger campaign. Almost every global automaker offered kind subscription, Tesla’s Full Self-Driving ($15,000 front, $99 $199 month), General Motors’ crash response roadside assistance system OnStar (between $25 $50 month), Toyota’s Remote Connect, offers remote start among goodies ($8 month $80 year).
surprise global carmakers jealous fantastical returns big tech firms like Microsoft Apple: Sell software, get Googley returns, theory goes. General Motors alone said wants wring $25 billion annual revenue subscriptions 2030. internal research suggests car buyers willing spend average $85 month, CEO Mary Barra said last year.
Automakers’ latest target subscriptions push—or shakedown, depending comfortably you’re sitting—is used car owners. average lifespan passenger vehicles steadily ticked recent years sits around 12 years US, cars cycling two three four owners hit scrap heap. Carmakers working making owners subscribers too.
“It’s massive market,” says Gary Silberg, heads global automotive sector accounting advisory firm KPMG. says automakers trying use increasingly software-stuffed car resolve “silly” situation. “You spend money building car, spend money designing building factories, yet don’t get talk customer,” Silberg says. connected vehicles apps go along mean automakers can. “Connected cars completely changed landscape customer interaction,” says Michael Bensel, vice president mobility connected services Cariad, Volkswagen Group’s automotive software subsidiary. describes company’s relationship car buyers shifting “from occasional contact dealerships times purchase, maintenance, repairs, continuous direct customer contact entire ownership period.”
Automakers starting figure transform used car owners subscribers. Today, reach used-vehicle owners either someone buys used vehicle certified dealer (about one-third US) new owner seeks app. (Automakers also reach owners case recalls, highly regulated contact local motor vehicle departments.)
General Motors spokesperson Anna Yu declined share specific numbers subscribers drive used cars, says “second owners loyal customers”—often proactively reached ask subscription-based products like OnStar Super Cruise, advanced driver assistance feature.
Cariad’s Bensel says VW-owned company able push “highly targeted digital campaigns”—that is, ads—directly onto drivers’ control panels apps. connectivity present new newer used cars, says, also allows Cariad pull data help VW “better understand usage vehicles well customer needs lifetime.” data, words, means automakers could maybe build better products attractive drivers cars new used—and likely helps tune digital ads too.
Drivers used cars automakers direct line to—whether email app—are often offered free trial periods aimed hooking consumer subscription model car ownership. many drivers used cars aren’t easily targeted, especially don’t buy cars automakers’ dealer-controlled networks.
2021 survey 2,000 US car owners led data analytics company LexisNexis Risk Solutions estimate 83 percent owners used cars built-in connectivity “remain untapped”—meaning automakers left money table.
Since 2021, LexisNexis offered service called Owner Check aimed helping automakers root used car owners. link “disparate data sets” determine car new owner, conversely, person new car, says Dave Nemtuda, company’s head automotive product. company won’t disclose automakers use Owner Check, says companies accounting 65 percent global auto market either testing discussions service.
new subscription offerings create new way automakers compete—and position brand relation others. Volvo’s deputy CEO Björn Annwall says company feels it’s unfair charge extra simply activate hardware that’s already car—“as heated seat,” says—but OK charge complex software. example might parking aid stitches images together multiple cameras. “This partly market research, partly it’s common sense,” says.
It’s reasonable theory, like subscription strategies automakers, one that’s largely untested. Ondrej Burkacky, senior partner consulting firm McKinsey works automotive software, says industry projections subscriber counts revenue proven overly optimistic.
unanswered question, says, this: “What people really going pay for?” VW’s Cariad reported $2 billion annual loss last year, amidst software product delays, onlyautomakerthat struggled build easy-to-use systems. companies’ software subscriber drives expand owners used cars, potential hopes dashed—or get people really, really mad.
