Give Every Remote Control Tracker
lost remote control minor crises. Barely annoyance really, typically resolved flipping enough couch cushions. perhaps it’s taken long disruptive types get around finding solutions. solutions now, though, they’re delightful.
Credit Roku first: pioneered remote-finding years ago, albeit higher-end streaming player models. past several months seen small revolution remote control tracking, enhancements improvements options previously unexplored—including Roku itself.
clearest beneficiaries tiny transformation Apple TV owners. Siri Remote, slim little number seems intentionally designed slide unfindable spots, offers cure disappearance beyond using Apple TV Remote app phone. (This works pinch, remotes physical buttons far better experience glass-tapping.) Even updated version hardware, announced April sale following month, remained grid. That’s especially surprising, perhaps, given Apple long ago designed so-called U1 chip whose main job help find things.
Fortunately, Apple use U1 AirTags, company’s recently announced answer Tile tracking widgets. Derrick Ensley, runs 3D-printing shop PrintSpired Designs, saw opportunity. Soon AirTags announcement, Ensley set work designing slim Siri Remote case room smuggle AirTag onboard. sells case schematics anyone wants print it, previous current generations hardware.
“Due thinness remote slick materials, easy slide couch cushions,” Ensley says Apple’s remote. “Of course, plenty folks can't fathom people lose remotes, father 2-year-old, quite easy misplace.”
Ensley says initial rush orders coverage tech news sites, still sells several dozen cases week. business benefited Apple’s design decisions, finds puzzling company didn’t offer kind lifeline owners missing remotes, even without incorporating U1 chip.
“It would've trivial Apple least incorporate small speaker second-generation Siri Remote help people find it,” says. “The U1 capabilities AirTag probably overkill remote, I've found asking Siri play sound remote's AirTag enough find quickly.”
Absent measures, though, AirTag case solution picking steam. week, accessory company Elago announced Apple TV Siri Remote R5 case, thick silicon shell includes AirTag slot. Elago addressed mischievous remote problem before, magnet-laden R1 case let plunk safely metal surface. “With introduction Apple’s new AirTags, saw natural segue new remote case,” says Elago general manager Michael Limm. “We knew demand kinds functional cases important customers well R1 case sold.”
Ensley says received requests branch remotes, particularly Roku, given ubiquity. Roku owners, case moot; remote already work you.

changed April, Roku announced Voice Remote Pro, upgrade enables voice-based tracking that’s compatible pretty much Roku hardware. say “Hey Roku, where’s remote?”—or fiddle around Roku app settings get “find remote”—it’ll beep you. Nice!
solutions common, unfortunately, they’re upgrades add-ons. Similarly, remotes aren’t Roku Apple TV, best bet probably going tacking Tile sticker, work fine also renders remote lumpy off-balance.
good news have, say, technology. world remote controls sort finding apparatus matter course seems tantalizingly close. (While it’s healthy wary tracking generally, feels less alarming remotes; tend know room it’s already. question is, pillow?)
Getting wouldn’t solve world’s big problems, would take care little one compounds. It’s one less frustration dampen day—always within reach, even sight.
