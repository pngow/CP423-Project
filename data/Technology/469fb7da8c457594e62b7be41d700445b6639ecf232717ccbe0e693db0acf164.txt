Texas Could Push Tech Platforms Censor Posts Abortion
Robin Marty writing 2021 book New Handbook Post-Roe America: Complete Guide Abortion Legality, Access, Practical Support, people often asked didn’t make online resource.
“I said, ‘Well, can't guarantee online always going accessible people,’” says Marty, director operations West Alabama Women's Center Tuscaloosa. concern women might one day restricted reading abortion online proved prescient.
State lawmakers Texas considering bill introduced last month would make illegal provide information access abortion. bill would also require internet service providers block websites offering content like Marty’s book, allow prosecution abortion pill “distribution networks,” permit anyone sue person shared anything access medical abortion. proposal borrows Texas law passed 2021 offers cash bounty citizens sue person helped facilitate access abortion care.
Texas proposal restrict information abortion follows recent flurry attempts limit reproductive rights US, particular focus medical abortions—that is, abortions induced medication. Experts worry passed, bill could incentivize platforms internet service providers (ISPs) censor abortion-related content broadly fear costly court cases.
“It’s scaring platforms ISPs speakers thinking liable speech,” says Jennifer Pinsof, staff attorney Electronic Frontier Foundation. “So it’s chilling effect advancing goal keeping information accessible people online.”
Access good information abortion could become even important new restrictions placed procedure. Earlier month, Texas judge ruled suspend Food Drug Administration’s approval mifepristone, pill combination misoprostol part standard process medical abortion. week, federal appeals court ruled though mifepristone could still used abortions, longer prescribed mail.
proposal block Texans accessing information abortion, introduced three male Republican representatives, far-reaching attempt date limit easily people learn abortion access US. without precedent. Arizona ban advertising abortion services books since 1873. states, including Virginia, Louisiana, Michigan, California, restrictions advertising procedure.
Free speech generally protected US First Amendment Constitution, technology platforms successfully argued Section 230 1996 Communications Decency Act means can’t held liable content posted users.
However, bill debated Texas could essentially sidestep least protections enlisting citizens police information abortions. Instead government cracking content, citizens would file civil court cases, potential targets including social platforms ISPs hosting websites social posts offering information abortion.
Pinsof says companies facing legal threats would little incentive defend free speech users helped avoid litigation. “We’ve seen different contexts platforms vulnerable censorship pressure they're afraid sued,” says Pinsof. “So easier take stuff potentially open liability.”
Another part law would require ISPs “make every reasonable technologically feasible effort block internet access information material intended assist facilitate efforts obtain elective abortion abortion-inducing drug.” also shields legal liability resulting takedowns, Pinsof thinks could encourage companies remove content related abortion.
Platforms currently watching case Supreme Court argues tech companies fact held liable content promoted platforms. weakening protection could expose companies additional legal hazards Texas proposed bill allowed pro-choice content shared services. Pinsof says law read making provision information abortion “illegal speakers themselves, also platforms.”
WIRED reached Twitter, Reddit, Meta, TikTok ask whether laws like Texas bill would induce change moderation policies abortion-related content. None responded. However, experts say platforms might preemptively begin limiting content related abortion.
Last year, WIRED found Meta already restricting abortion content platforms, regularly removing posts referenced accessing abortion pills rules barring sale “illegal regulated goods."
Texas bill could also major implications search engines, making difficult women find accurate information abortion services. So-called “crisis pregnancy centers”—operated anti-choice organizations—often use promoted results get top searches abortion providers.
“There’s effectively competition pro- anti-choice groups win slots top Google search,” says Callum Hood, head research Center Countering Digital Hate, nonprofit tracks disinformation. “There alternative search results anti-choice groups say abortion,” says.
Neither Google Microsoft responded requests comment whether search results ads might modified restricted response Texas bill.
Hood says worries censorship could lead ISPs decide hosting abortion-related websites carries many risks. ISPs previously blocked websites illicit materials like child pornography.
“The easiest thing say just, ‘We're going host website that’s abortion. Full stop,’” says Hood. “It going create incentive take simple steps, avoid ambiguity whether facilitating access information abortion-inducing drugs.”
Marty says that, bill enacted, activists work ways around it, previous restrictions. acknowledges strategies may still leave many women without critical information, digital information become important.
Pro-choice activists educators sometimes use QR codes, easily printed stickers posters left inconspicuously public places point people abortion information. “Most activism already continue pivot QR codes ways providing informational links without actual information visible text form,” says. “But even QR code whisper network. know thing find information on.”
