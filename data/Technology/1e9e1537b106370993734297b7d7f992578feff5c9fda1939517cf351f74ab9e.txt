Bipartisan Senate bill would ban social media algorithms minors
bipartisan effort “protect kids harm,” unlikely cohort senators introduced bill would restrict minors’ access social media, well ban companies using algorithms recommend content minors.
Senators Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), Chris Murphy (D-Conn), Katie Britt (R-Ala) Tom Cotton (R-Ark) introduced Protecting Kids Social Media Act Wednesday. bill would set minimum age 13 use social media sites, would require parental consent age verification users 18.
“The growing evidence clear: social media making kids depressed wreaking havoc mental health. kids suffering, social media companies profiting. needs stop,” Schatz said press release. “Our bill help us stop growing social media health crisis among kids setting minimum age preventing companies using algorithms automatically feed addictive content based personal information.”
social media companies, like TikTok YouTube, launched kid-friendly versions platforms content limits parental controls, age verification largely based honor system.
bill signed law, social media companies forbidden using “personal data” user recommend content “unless platform knows reasonably believes individual age 18 older according age verification process used platform,” bill’s text reads. Advertising minors still allowed, long it’s “solely based context,” isn’t “targeted recommended based personal data” user.
bill’s language doesn’t outline algorithms regulated. representative Schatz immediately respond request comment.
Twitter, users already raised concerns Protecting Kids Social Media Act, questioned whether proposed regulations even enforceable.
“Broadly speaking I’d say this: yes, Big Tech companies harming kids,” Evan Greer, director digital rights nonprofit Fight Future, said tweet responding Murphy. “We stop forcing companies change business practices, kicking kids internet taking away kids rights.”
Alejandra Caraballo, civil rights attorney clinical instructor Harvard Law School’s Cyberlaw Clinic, also responded Murphy’s tweet announcing bill, described prohibiting algorithms kids.
“With due respect Senator, terribly misinformed statement social media technology. might well try saying you’re banning javascript teens,” said.
Murphy decried social media companies “100% committed addicting children screens” press release.
“The alarm bells social media’s devastating impact kids sounding long time, yet time time again, companies proven care profit preventing well-documented harm cause,” said. “In particular, algorithms sending many dangerous online rabbit holes, little chance parents know kids seeing online.”
social media policies already require users least 13 years old, enforcement flimsy best. Minors easily fly radar submitting fake date birth checking box attesting supposed age. bill would require social media platforms take “reasonable steps beyond merely requiring attestation,” instead employing “existing age verification technologies” ensure users age claim be.
bill’s language forbids companies storing using information collected verification process “for purpose.” instead proposes free “Pilot Program,” regulated Secretary Commerce, would provide “secure digital identification credential individuals citizens lawful residents United States.”
Pilot Program supposed “meet exceed highest cybersecurity standards” consumer products, bill promises anonymized aggregate data stored.
isn’t first bipartisan effort try curb kids’ internet use. Last year, Senators Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn) Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn) introduced Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA), would require sites provide parental control tools limit content users 16 access. Dozens civil liberties organizations, including American Civil Liberties Union, Electronic Frontier Foundation, Fight Future GLAAD, opposed bill.
Protecting Kids Social Media Act follows larger nationwide push age verification online. year, Louisiana, Mississippi, Virginia Utah passed laws requiring users submit government-issued ID order view porn sites. Eleven states proposed similar laws. digital privacy advocates expressed concerns age verification data stored used.
“Age verification requirements may require users provide platforms personally identifiable information date birth government-issued identification documents, threaten users’ privacy, including risk data breaches, chill willingness access sensitive information online cannot anonymously,” letter said. “Rather age-gating privacy settings safety tools apply minors, Congress focus ensuring users, regardless age, benefit strong privacy protections passing comprehensive privacy legislation.”
