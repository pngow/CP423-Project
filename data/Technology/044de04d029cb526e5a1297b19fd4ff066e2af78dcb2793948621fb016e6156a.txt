Sea Levels Rise, East Coast Also Sinking
Climate scientists already know East Coast United States could see around foot sea-level rise 2050, catastrophic own. beginning thoroughly measure “hidden vulnerability” make matters far worse: coastline also sinking. It’s phenomenon known subsidence, it’s poised make rising ocean dangerous, people coastal ecosystems.
New research published journal Nature Communications finds Atlantic Coast—home third US population—is dropping several millimeters per year. Charleston, South Carolina, Chesapeake Bay, it’s 5 millimeters (a fifth inch). areas Delaware, it’s much twice that.
Five millimeters annual sea-level rise along stretch coastline, plus 5 millimeters subsidence there, effectively 10 millimeters relative sea-level rise. Atlantic coastal cities already suffering persistent flooding, deluge get worse sink seas rise. Yet high-resolution subsidence data like isn’t yet taken account coastal hazard assessments. “What want really bring awareness missing component, based analysis actually makes near-future vulnerability lot worse would expect sea-level rise alone,” says Manoochehr Shirzaei, environmental security expert Virginia Tech coauthor new paper.
primary cause dramatic land subsidence over-extracting groundwater it, makes terrain collapse like empty water bottle. San Jose, California, lowered elevation much 12 feet. combination sea-level rise subsidence could inundate 165 square miles Bay Area coastline 2100, according Shirzaei’s previous research. Parts Jakarta sinking 10 inches year, forcing Indonesia move capital elsewhere. Extracting oil also causes subsidence, particularly acute problem Houston-Galveston area. landfill sediments along coastlines also settle time.
scientists aware US coastlines sinking, haven’t much data show local differences rates. Subsidence varies significantly even short distances, given variations underlying geology nearby human activity. new paper, Shirzaei lead author Leonard Ohenhen, also environmental security expert Virginia Tech, used data highly sensitive satellite fired radar signals Earth, analyzed bounced back determine coastal deformation. years 2007 2020, along 3,500 kilometers (2,200 miles) Atlantic coast.
researchers found particularly intense subsidence agricultural areas, groundwater extracted feed crops—which turn vulnerable flooding elevation drops. also found Atlantic coastal cities seeing 3 millimeters subsidence year, including Boston New York City. elevation falls, destabilizes above-ground infrastructure like buildings roads, well buried pipes cables.
“Three millimeters year seems like really tiny number,” says Ohenhen, really matters “the cumulative effect much sinking occur years.” could get worse, predicts. “The East Coast one fastest-growing areas US terms population. population, means people use water, increase fast land sinking.”
People also already destroying wetlands mitigate sea-level rise along East Coast, order develop them. Wetlands absorb storm surges, keeping seawater reaching farther inland. sea levels naturally gone millennia, wetlands moved inland back response. “But put hard stop building ‘fence’—our buildings whatever—so wetlands longer migrate landward,” says Ohenhen. They’re hemmed in, dooming drown rising seas. Humans make matters worse damming rivers, thus preventing sediment flowing coast, would normally add elevation delta wetland. Instead, ecosystems continue subsiding.
Rising seas subsidence also conspiring create “ghost forests” along Atlantic Coast. Saltwater infiltrates fresh groundwater, killing trees whose roots would normally hold soil together. “It causes subsidence areas, intrusion saltwater,” says Ohenhen. “It’s rapid expansion ghost forests.”
Coastal ecosystems vital stores carbon: plants grow, absorb CO2 atmosphere spit oxygen. saltwater killing biomass, it’s killing carbon sink, meaning CO2 remain atmosphere cause warming—and drive sea levels.
good news subsidence halted, first stopping overextraction groundwater, ideally pumping water back ground. human population keeps growing, demand water, especially certain regions receive less rainfall due climate change. groundwater also threatened seawater intrusion. Restoring coastal ecosystems naturally buffer storm surges rising sea levels could help keep water supply drinkable. “Number one ensuring much wetlands stay healthy,” says Natalie Snider, associate vice president Climate Resilient Coasts Watersheds program Environmental Defense Fund, wasn’t involved new paper.
Precise satellite data like also help scientists policymakers better understand subsidence—not it’s happening, rate—and actually done it. “The accurate detailed get data available,” says Snider, “the better solutions we’re going develop.”
