Three things love
gain foothold market? marketing customer acquisition channels? question partially answered Careerist, worries little.
deck sets number alarm bells — I’ll get moment — imagine founding team fought uphill battle pitching investors. said that, company go Combinator claims successful raising $8 million round Cathexis, Xploration, Cold Start Ventures, Grant Park Ventures others. Let’s dig look see find clues company caught eye investors.
traction, nothing else matters

Traction truly resolves issues company may possibly have. Building company growing half million dollars $12 million revenue four years pretty impressive, especially given point, according press release, company raised $1.2 million capital. Turning $1.2 million investment $12 million revenue, turns out, enough catch attention investors.
Extraordinary customer acquisition
order drive much revenue, you’ve got find customers somewhere, seems like Careerist cracked nut:
slides, company claims gets 35% traffic organically another 25% referrals. two extremely powerful, low-cost acquisition channels drive extraordinary, high-value customers. that’s double-edged sword. Referrals generally scale well alongside channels: get 0.2 referral average per customer, acquire 10 customers, get two “free” customers due referrals. challenge organic traffic, much harder scale demand. words, close $8 million round funding, going accelerate sales dramatically?
doesn’t specify whether channels (Google, webinars Facebook) paid acquisition channels. are, I’d expect see cost acquisition (CAC) here, analysis whether customers also end referring additional customers. overall, there’s lot love slide: Finding 1,600 customers paying $12,000+ (see slide 7 slide deck, below) objectively impressive.
cool thing is, sense-check numbers: company claims 1,600 customers done cumulative $19 million revenue. works around $12,000 per customer, proving numbers internally consistent.
That’s hell market size
[Slide 10] E-learning huge, finding jobs popular hiring right staff crucial. adds up. Image Credits: Careerist
Careerist finds curious space here, huge opportunity. fact, company wasn’t seeing extraordinary traction lifetime value (LTV), numbers would hard believe. withthe traction place, numbers seem less plausible. Besides, truly enormous markets (hiring, training, etc.) market sizing essentially checkbox.
One example would toothpaste: There’s doubt there’s huge market it, investor argue that. questions become “What gain foothold markets?” “What marketing customer acquisition channels?” Careerist partially answers questions, worries little.
positives Careerist pitch deck, unfortunately, also Texas-sized red flags make wonder company successful raising money all. suspect answer, alluded above, traction. rest teardown, I’ll take look three things Careerist could improved done differently, along full pitch deck.
