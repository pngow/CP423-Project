two different exchanges sanctioned two different regulators alleged violations entirely different regulatory regimes shows increasing complexity operating environment crypto firms US, turf war SEC CFTC escalates. dramatic collapse FTX November 2022, regulators adopted aggressive—even hostile—approach crypto industry, using enforcement actions stake claim jurisdiction.
“If people wondered attitude beginning year, know it’s hostile,” says Mick Mulvaney, former White House chief staff advisor crypto compliance platform Astra Protocol. “I don’t think FTX cause, much excuse.”
Since start year, SEC launched flurry cases crypto companies individuals US. January, regulator charged crypto exchange Gemini crypto lender Genesis Global Capital service allowed US customers earn interest tokens, agency alleged unregistered securities offering. Twitter thread, Gemini cofounder Tyler Winklevoss called charges “a manufactured parking ticket.” Neither Gemini Genesis responded requests comment.
February, regulator reached settlement another exchange, Kraken, agreed halt service gave US customers ability earn rewards locking crypto. regulator also issued crypto firm Paxos warning intent sue BUSD stablecoin, SEC asserts security. statement, Paxos wrote “categorically disagrees SEC.”
March, SEC charged Justin Sun, founder TRON blockchain, market manipulation, well eight celebrities—including likes Lindsay Lohan Ne-Yo—with “illegally touting” Sun-related tokens without disclosing paid so. Sun respond request comment.
Mulvaney says thinks agency “flexing muscle” enforcement actions way strengthen claim industry, so, lost impartiality.
Even within SEC, disagreement agency handling crypto. Hester Peirce, one five SEC commissioners, dissented publicly multiple crypto-related actions, effort, says, foster discussion heal “dysfunctional” relationship agency crypto industry.
“We haven’t done job regulator. provided road compliance, instead bringing enforcement actions fact,” says Peirce. Even though agency’s actions motivated desire protect investors, “the strategy one jurisdictional maximalization,” says. “And one way plant flag bring enforcement action.”
SEC chair Gary Gensler's office respond request comment.

absence clear guidance Congress whether SEC CFTC take point regulating industry, crypto businesses must anticipate possible complaints directions. made difficult lack crypto-specific guidelines agencies.
“It’s like driving road, signs lanes, trying figure rules based gets pulled over,” says Dave Siemer, CEO Los Angeles–based crypto investment firm Wave Digital Assets. “You’re guessing.”
Crypto companies say they’re particularly frustrated regulatory onslaught they’ve tried engage SEC CFTC, asked clearer, comprehensive rules road.
Speaking WIRED, Paul Grewal, chief legal officer Coinbase, claims company’s interactions SEC akin “one-sided monologues” dialogs. Attempts help map parts crypto industry fit within existing rule structures, says, largely garnered response.
“Coinbase asking special treatment. want registered held strict standards,” Grewal says. “But SEC outright refused promulgate basic rules, instead relying regime regulation enforcement.”
Gensler called crypto firms register SEC, process would theoretically minimize chances retrospective legal action ensuring operate compliance regulator’s expectations get-go. idea registration simple filling online form inflamed tensions; Grewal says characterization registration process “simply true” businesses tried register “failed miserably.”
business’s application rejected SEC, cannot offer securities-related services US, least form described application. confusion classification crypto assets, eventuality could pose “existential threat,” says Siemer. “To go register means cease exist,” says. “There framework; path.”
question crypto could resolved courts. ongoing case SEC cross-border payments company Ripple cryptocurrency XRP, example, expected go way clarifying whether cryptocurrencies treated securities (and regulated SEC) not. two years, verdict case near, it’s playing district court, establish binding precedent. However, victory SEC would strengthen case becoming de facto crypto regulator.

Mulvaney, spent six years House Representatives, says unlikely anything resembling comprehensive crypto legislation makes way Congress year, ahead 2024 presidential election. silver lining, says, crypto “bipartisan”—it appeals libertarian beliefs sides political divide—which means issue legislation settled along “tribal lines.”
“It’s tough operate regulation, don’t know are,” says Mulvaney. “You don’t want over-regulated … need enough give guidance clarity. That’s sweet spot.”
parts crypto community, refusal regulators set clear lines interpreted deliberate attempt squeeze industry US.
Irrespective intention, consequence continued ambiguity classification crypto assets, regulator charge, process registering services government likely exodus crypto businesses country, say Mulvaney Siemer.

Peirce, SEC commissioner, says agency’s objective help enable safe experimentation technology, push crypto industry offshore. sympathetic interpretation. “If you’re trying send message want crypto United States, want compliant, way send message help companies [to become compliant]. don’t see happening,” says.
