Bluesky’s best shot success embrace shitposting
joined many social media websites since October 27, 2022, fateful day Elon Musk tanked net worth volunteered worst job world. There’s Mastodon, T2, Spoutible, Hive, Post, Cohost many more, Twitter alternative felt promising Bluesky. is, part, much shitposting going there.
Bluesky hatched Twitter’s nest 2019, Twitter founder Jack Dorsey announced platform would fund small, independent team develop decentralized standard social media. Like Mastodon, Bluesky plans federated, meaning endless individually operated communities exist within open source network. could ever considered Musk would buy Twitter, “bluesky initiative” central company’s long game — independent team launched invite-only beta, still operating funding Dorsey. (Yes, know sad excited Twitter alternative literally funded Twitter founder publicly declared Musk “singular solution” trusts old company.)
one astute Bluesky user, Pavel Samsonov, wrote: “bluesky (serious people making silly little posts) spiritual opposite linkedin (deeply silly people trying write serious thoughtposts).” Samsonov even included handy visual aid.

It’s apt description. I’m seeing journalists tech folk follow Twitter — even found someone know Weird Facebook — people aren’t talking earning reports, layoffs stocks. particular moment, Bluesky collection people remain addicted adrenaline Twitteresque microblogging exhausted constant onslaught asinine discourse Musky shenanigans. Enter: shitposting.
feels like days, silly chaotic culture developed Bluesky. name posts, like Twitter tweets, Mastodon used toots retired branding they’re cowards. So, people calling Bluesky posts “skeets,” portmanteau “tweet” “sky” pretty sure slang ejaculate fluid fact check holding one last shred sanity.
Rich Burroughs, developer advocate, thinks culture formed top down. Bluesky developers active platform they’re building real time, responding users’ questions, complaints feature suggestions, still acting like real person.
“Some staff seem accomplished shitposters themselves, think great energy lacking Twitter alternatives,” Burroughs told TechCrunch. “People keep building super serious feeling platforms compete Twitter, what’s happening Bluesky feels lot like early Twitter days, became successful.”
publicly feuding Musk, gave blue check will, legendary shitposter Dril joined Bluesky today. Bryan Newbold, employee Bluesky, posted, “if first @dril.bsky.social poast sucks going burn whole thing try again.”

Dril fandom seems rage among Bluesky team. Another developer, Emily Liu, posted Newbold gifted book Dril’s best tweets upon joining team (also pictured book called “There Antimemetics Division,” sounds like something read ASAP). fact seemed bit perfect arguing thesis Bluesky succeed deliberately cultivating shitposting, double-checked Newbold make sure legit. replied: “It Public Stated Policy Bluesky PBLLC New Employees Shall Receive Finest @dril.bsky.social Tweets Printed Form.” Make will.
dismayed Twitter users scrambled find new platform call home, flocked Tumblr, another social network largely failed monetize user base deliberately resistant behaving predictably. Tumblr rolled creator subscription product, users vehemently opposed it. per data November, Tumblr users purchased dashboard crabs (pixelated crabs dance around dashboard gifted friends) actual creator subscriptions. targeted gag, Tumblr also offered users chance buy one, two blue checks $8.
spirit, Bluesky feels bit like Tumblr, except yet seen anyone drop link Archive and/or Ray-Ban sale. unlike Tumblr, aren’t high school kids shitposting “Supernatural”; they’re adults jobs looking social media experience far removed LinkedIn possible.
Sure, generalization, perhaps serious corner Bluesky yet encountered. Bluesky seems taken people enjoyed Mastodon Twitter mushed together, without many bad parts. Though Bluesky’s architecture similar Mastodon’s, Bluesky intuitive, Mastodon comes inaccessible: Choosing instance join feels like impossible task, longtime users defensive established tooting posting norms, make joining conversation intimidating. tech reporter Paris Martineau wrote Bluesky, “genuinely, think mastodon failed discouraged shitposting.”
Bluesky still lot overcome. platform yet contend large-scale content moderation concerns come decentralization, app remains walled garden (please don’t DM invite codes; any). least sliver internet history, Bluesky feeling good. Dril here.
