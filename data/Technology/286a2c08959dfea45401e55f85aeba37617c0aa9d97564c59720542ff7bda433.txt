Aleksandar found crypto, made equivalent $500 month working computer repair technician and, later, cash-transfer company MoneyGram. earned slightly national average North Macedonia, lives. crypto made rich.
2019, 20 years old, Aleksandar—who asked name changed could discuss private financial affairs—took $5,000 loan invest cryptocurrencies. risk, he’d watched market falling felt could snag bargain. happened, ended timing dip almost perfectly. Two years later, crypto gone another hot streak, Aleksandar sitting $105,000. North Macedonia, says, that’s almost like winning lottery.
that’s luck ended. Aleksandar trading FTX. crypto exchange, whose founder facing 13 criminal charges, went bankrupt November, Aleksandar’s savings locked inside. Short money, sell car take loan family members get by. found couldn’t sleep without drink. worst part, says, “stupid” felt made sucker. “I really dark place. first months literal hell.”
Aleksandar one hundreds thousands people around world unable access funds turmoil crypto industry took leading players. Along FTX, crypto lenders Celsius, Voyager Digital, BlockFi, Genesis Global Capital, well hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC), collapsed, leaving investors—from small traders financial institutions—at mercy bankruptcy proceedings.
collapses, difficult situations investors found in, helped drive growth digital marketplaces trading bankruptcy claims, give speculators willing wait legal cases chance large returns cut-price exposure crypto. Some, like Open Exchange, headed former founders bankrupt hedge fund 3AC, even trying tokenize claims, turning crypto failures new tokens holders either sell post collateral.
claim holders accuse marketplaces buyers taking advantage distressed sellers. money locked away, potentially years, others take hard decision sell claims fraction paper value.
Aleksandar chose sell directly investment fund Cherokee Acquisition, also operates Claims Market, one biggest public bankruptcy claim marketplaces. received fewer 20 cents dollar FTX claim, explains, least allowed “be done move on.”
market bankruptcy claims isn’t new; it’s going least since 1980s. somebody buys bankruptcy claim, buying IOU—a right portion money returned creditors end bankruptcy case. length bankruptcy proceedings varies drastically, depending extent mess, (as crypto exchange Mt. Gox) take long decade close.
motivations side claim sales different, complementary. seller either needs immediate cash meet bills, wants write losses tax purposes, believes earn greater return investing money elsewhere. buyer, meanwhile, wagering value eventually returned creditors exceed amount paid claims.
Claim sales typically happened behind closed doors, taking place financial institutions. past years, public marketplaces bankruptcy claims, Xclaim Claims Market, emerged, bringing degree transparency opaque market allowing almost anyone claim list it.
“We’re giving people power make choice otherwise wouldn’t have,” Matthew Sedigh, founder Xclaim, says.
growth marketplaces catalyzed small part bankruptcies crypto sector. $20 billion $30 billion currently locked crypto bankruptcies, according estimates Open Exchange Xclaim.
late 2022, Xclaim pivoted focus exclusively crypto bankruptcies. Since then, marketplace, January listed $200 million total claims, attracted users drawn greater revenue two previous years combined, Sedigh says.
Buying claims crypto bankruptcies seen way invest crypto discount. Although creditor’s claim valued dollars date bankruptcy filing, denominated crypto, balance sheets firms made largely crypto assets. Therefore, crypto appreciate price, claim holders would receive greater return. case Mt. Gox, judge even decided claim holders share fully rise crypto prices, meaning set make return 100 percent claims redistribution begins October 31.
However, purchasing claims faint heart, says Thomas Braziel, founder 507 Capital, investment company specializes distressed debt, holds large position Mt. Gox bankruptcy others. creditors sometimes misrepresent value claims, intentionally otherwise—some people “fib around edges,” says Braziel—but claims turn entirely fraudulent.
instances, buyer might discover claim subject clawbacks, original holder made undisclosed withdrawals shortly bankruptcy, eating profit might hope make. bankruptcies, funds withdrawn 90 days filing later pulled back estate, avoid scenario minority creditors rewarded faster trigger.
reasons, says Muhammed Yesilhark, chief investment officer asset management company NOIA Capital, thorough due diligence vital. “If can’t find three four people industry vouch seller, don’t get involved. Anything remotely smelly, don’t touch,” says. “It’s like buying toilet paper Amazon.”
competition claims FTX bankruptcy began heat up, NOIA settled strategy would help firm minimize risk outcompete buyers: would pay going rate claims promise original claim holders 20 percent upside event payout.
victims crypto collapses reacted badly offers buy bankruptcy claims. Michael, Celsius creditor New York, asked identified first name alone order discuss private financial matters, says hoping sell $450,000 claim “ASAP,” order reinvest crypto market. balked 20 cents dollar offered Cherokee, describes “vulture thieves.”
Bradley Max, director Cherokee, bemused “demonization” buyers marketplace operators. says companies like provide important liquidity, giving wish sell option so. case, buyers far guaranteed make profit.
“The market efficient; competition buy claims result fair market price, based current facts circumstances case,” Max says. “Like investing, sometimes investors get right, sometimes don’t. happen claims buyers end paying way ever recovered.”
Michael’s attitude uncommon Telegram channels creditors congregate discuss progress bankruptcies. Aleksandar asked selling FTX claim, received angry messages, says, telling “come doomer attitude.” separate encounter, September, Cherokee representative trying drum business Celsius group chat told admin messages “tacky” made sound like “used car salesman.”
New entrants bankruptcy claims marketplace business attracted similar level contempt, like Open Exchange, firm developing way turn bankruptcy claims easily tradable tokens. fact project headed Davies Zhu, 3AC founders, executives crypto exchange CoinFLEX, filed restructuring August, irony lost nobody.
plan first came light January 16, CoinDesk got hold pitch deck. new marketplace provisionally branded “GTX”—simply “because G comes F”—but would also allow customers trade claims 3AC. tweet, Nic Carter, partner venture capital firm Castle Island Ventures, questioned whether ethical Davies Zhu “skim fees” claims company’s bankruptcy.
However, Leslie Lamb, CEO Open Exchange, says unfair characterization. “Our first priority give people option able trade claim,” says. “We want find many paths help creditors recover value, across many bankruptcy estates, possible.”
Whether bankruptcy claims safely tokenized another question. claim unique, collecting together turning set homogenous tokens difficult. Lamb insists system viable help creditors “benefit liquidity fairer pricing,” regardless size claim. Open Exchange preparing launch claims trading service spring says thousands claim holders already signed up.
bankruptcy marketplaces pitch place small investors cash move on, reality smaller creditors tend receive raw deal pricing—or least, large claims command premium. cost vetting claim administering sale, majority buyers looking small number large claims, large number small ones.
number institutional investors, like hedge fund Galois Capital, forced circumstance sales, others reluctant sell creditors Telegram. Kyle Samani, managing partner Multicoin Capital, investment firm tens millions dollars tied FTX, says company never considered selling claim. “The kinds people buying claims obviously aiming make high returns,” says Samani. “So would sell them?”
extent regular people never going come bankruptcy good shape, whether choose sell claim not. harsh truth, says Braziel, game rigged anyone lacking resources expertise fight corner.
“In bankruptcies, squeaky wheel gets grease,” says. “The guys millions dollars stake hire expensive bankruptcy lawyers argue them. people really get hurt small [creditors], get fucking walked over.”
decision sell easy one people caught FTX crypto bankruptcies, whose desire close painful chapter rubs determination avoid taken advantage twice over. least, suggests Aleksandar, selling allows creditors take back measure agency, even comes financial cost.
Aleksandar well aware inequities bankruptcy food chain—and made decision sell easier one. “The big fish,” says, “are gonna eat first.”
