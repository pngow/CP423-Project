Three days Christmas 2022, Amazon Prime Air set deliver first commercial package drone residential customer Lockeford, California. supposed celebration, culmination tens thousands test flights, years dealing Federal Aviation Administration paperwork, decade development, $2 billion investment.
Early morning, 40 people—including FAA officials, Amazon engineers, public relations staff, Prime Air chief pilot Jim Mullin—waited outside steel frame warehouse flat, 20-acre parcel land flanked vineyards. Inside warehouse, flight crew loaded drone—a six-propeller, roughly 80-pound carbon-fiber MK27-2—with lithium-ion battery box containing Exploding Kittens card game. operator charge tried load flight package, software wouldn’t boot up, says former employee asked remain anonymous fear retaliation: “That’s panic started set in, higher-ups went war-room mode.”
teams Amazon’s headquarters Seattle tried diagnose issue, flight crew powered second drone. one took expected, whirring loudly like airborne lawnmower. reached intended destination—the backyard single-family home roughly 1,500 feet away, Taylor Ranch Road—it turned around started heading back. drone’s sensors identified 2.5-foot-wide QR-code-like marker aiming customer’s yard wasn’t supposed be.

November 2013, 60 Minutes interview, Amazon’s then-CEO Jeff Bezos revealed dream delivering packages 5 pounds—roughly 85 percent Amazon’s products—to customers drone within four five years. Since then, story mainly one technical regulatory setbacks, ambitious targets missed, least one fiery crash, and, recently, layoffs. customer delivery Lockeford was, among things, vivid demonstration program’s limitations.
took nearly three hours deliver card game morning. marker repositioned, GPS synced. drone made wobbly ascent flew ground observer (referred flight crew “crossing guard”), stationed truck road meet FAA requirements maintaining visual line sight drone. hovered briefly target, dropped cardboard package altitude 10 feet.
experience “was really disheartening,” former employee says. “But wasn’t unexpected. failures almost every day.”
Lockeford, town around 3,500 residents 40 miles south Sacramento, built around light industrial shops, cherry orchards, nut farms, strawberry fields. chosen one Amazon’s first two customer-delivery sites it’s flat, near airport, usually dry, according former employee involved selection process. (The live commercial delivery site, College Station, Texas, picked similar reasons, plus proximity Texas A&M, university robust aerospace program.)
first official customer drone delivery Lockeford signed service Amazon promoted children’s school science fair September 2022. asked anonymity security reasons job criminal justice. figured maybe drone delivery future: “And I’ll tell kids, ‘You got first Amazon drone delivery ever.’ Kind cool bragging rights them.”
Later month, Amazon representative paid visit house Taylor Ranch Road, dead-end street that’s home five houses. rep surveyed property—a 5-acre parcel swimming pool, trampoline, chicken coop—to confirm yard necessary air clearance (no overhanging tree limbs power lines) 10-foot clearance radius install metal stake, plastic sheet emblazoned Amazon logo, landing pad QR-code-like fiducial marker drone would fly toward lowering make drop. signed waiver requiring family stay backyard scheduled delivery times. approved, sent email link private Amazon landing page displaying items available drone delivery: “Toothpaste, lots condoms, things like that,” says.
man’s actual first deliveries—an Amazon Fire TV stick pack gum received earlier fall—were unofficial, Prime Air hadn’t gained FAA approval fly drones commercially. December card-game drop, used service buy refrigerator filter, arrived hour, promised. time, small fleet Prime Air pickups visual observers showed house keep eye drones. Deliveries available Thursday Monday, there’s rain strong wind, constants Lockeford year.
Next door, retiree Dan Zamarripa, another one Prime Air’s first customers, says he’s used service buy batteries, moisturizing cream, toilet handle. reason Zamarripa continues use seems less luxury one-hour drone delivery, four $50 gift cards Amazon gave him—essentially free credits drone delivery—and personal quest help “work bugs.” Prime Air employees come house observe drones, he’s chatty them, says: “One time made 58, 59 minutes, said, ‘You’re lucky live street.’”
reason many Amazon employees need watch drones deliver that, decade program, Prime Air still hasn’t received type certification FAA fly active roadways people—the kind Cessna’s light aircraft Matternet’s M2 drones have. Instead, Prime Air’s drones operate experimental aircraft tangle federal exemptions (18601B 18602B among recent) severely restrict Part 135 authorization, allows company operate on-demand air deliveries.
meant long stretches, even though Amazon could conduct test deliveries select farms homes Pendleton Corvallis, Oregon, Crows Landing, California, could collect payment delivered goods, effectively putting program hold.

Amazon struggled persuade FAA extend leash, companies’ drone delivery programs moved forward.
Wing, drone delivery subsidiary Google’s parent company, Alphabet, first industry obtain Part 135 certificate, April 2019, delivery programs Virginia, Texas, parts Finland, Ireland Australia. Customers use Wing smartphone app order items drugstore Walgreens. Wing completed 300,000 commercial deliveries worldwide.
there’s Amazon’s longtime retail rival Walmart, which, partnership DroneUp, Flytrex, Zipline, conducted 6,000 paid deliveries 2022 recently expanded 34 stores across seven US states. DroneUp founder CEO Tom Walker says company made 108,000 flights without “a single reportable incident.” (There six crashes, none resulted injury property damage exceeding $500).
crucial 18601B exemption finally came Amazon November 2022, Prime Air executives hoped for. operations “over people,” “over roadways,” within “100 feet laterally person phases flight” required special approval FAA administrator. Visual observers, before, needed keep line sight drones launch landing. Observers also notify pilot obstructions posed risk operation, stray dogs, hobbyist drones, kites, children.
Whether Amazon’s drones actually safe fly roads residential areas debated among company’s flight crews safety teams.
members units say string crashes due motor failures, overheating electronic speed controllers, inexplicable in-flight software reboots. One, June 2021, resulted MK27 drone overheating near launchpad plummeting ground, leading 25-acre brushfire Pendleton, Oregon.
former flight operator works closely Prime Air’s drones says safety issues caused faulty motors hardware issues largely resolved MK27-2, unforeseen software bugs still crop up. “The computer, ACS, brain whole thing, constantly telling aircraft it,” say. “So restarts, you’re longer getting power signals command motors. Everything goes offline. turns brick falls sky.”
asked email share evidence Amazon’s MK27-2 drones safe ready customer deliveries, spokesperson Maria Boschetti responded: “We use closed, private facility test systems limits beyond. rigorous testing like this, expect types events occur apply learnings flight toward improving safety. one ever injured harmed result flights, test done compliance applicable regulations.” added “there never incident customer delivery flights.”
granting November exemption, FAA acknowledged enhanced safety features MK27-2’s perception system. Still, regulatory hesitance technical failures frustrated Amazon’s attempts hit incredibly aggressive goals.
2020, company hired David Carbon, former Boeing executive known uncompromising leadership style, vice president Prime Air. Carbon’s approach sharp break predecessor Gur Kimchi, focused R&D experimentation operational victories. new VP outsourced parts drone production third-party manufacturers set ambitious targets conduct 12,000 trial test flights, recruit 1,300 test customers drone delivery program 2022, deliver 500 million packages drone annually end decade.
“That kind ramp-up feasible,” says former flight operator, declined share name terms severance agreement. “We didn’t bodies, didn’t resources, didn’t space it. lot decisions made plan that, fundamentally, people front lines knew couldn’t hit established time frame.”
Prime Air fewer bodies, targets could even difficult hit. Amazon announced layoffs 27,000 employees far year, former employees say round cuts January 18 affected around 140 Prime Air’s 850 employees. Amazon spokesperson Av Zammit declined confirm number Prime Air layoffs, referring, instead, message CEO Andy Jassy company’s overall headcount reduction.
Lockeford College Station, teams roughly 30 people employed prior layoffs, half roles slashed, according report Verge.
Many terminated roles related upper mid-level safety roles, former employees say, including Level 7 safety security manager Matt Birch, Level 6 ground safety security manager, five Level 4 Level 5 flight safety officer manager positions.
reductions could related drone’s latest FAA exemptions, eliminate need several on-ground staff oversee drone flights. One former employee says company could also redirecting efforts funding away flight-testing MK27-2 focus developing MK30—a lighter, smaller drone fly light rain—which set go service 2024. Others think Amazon waiting see whether proposed federal legislation, Increasing Competitiveness American Drones Act 2023, passes changes FAA’s licensing requirements drones. Spokesperson Maria Boschetti said email “it’s wrong suggest role reductions delays affect commitment safety change long-term plans deliver program customers.” added Amazon “excited [drone delivery] now” 10 years ago.
time layoffs January, customer deliveries Lockeford happened Taylor Ranch Road, street five homes clear view Amazon facility across vineyard, according two former employees site. March 24, Lockeford service reached nine customers, says Zamarripa, spoke Prime Air visual observer. Still, may soon write program failure.

Micah Lloyd, 47-year-old building-supply sales manager signed Prime Air drone delivery October, recently received eighth delivery house end Taylor Ranch Road. first, reservations enrolling wary waiver sign, remains inbox longer opened. remembers, form, sent via DocuSign, contained “legalese” granted Amazon employees permission come property drone fall there. He’s worried that, says, “a big fence dogs.” concerning, Lloyd says, language specifying “anything Amazon videotaped would considered property.” (Zammit said email customers “do sign waiver granting rights” language “likely refers limited pre-delivery testing took place September October last year customer deliveries started.”)
case, point may moot. Lloyd, says family enjoys watching drones descend family’s rear deck, willing accept original terms understood them. spoke WIRED mid-March, perusing Gillette razor blade refills Prime Air website. says shopaholic, like many Americans—driven buy things like soap, batteries, bandages convenience online delivery services like Amazon’s. Low prices one-hour delivery hard resist, he’s received $150 gift cards incentives sweeten deal.
“This obviously future,” says. “Soon they’ll flying place, not? worst thing happen don’t like it, cancel service.”
