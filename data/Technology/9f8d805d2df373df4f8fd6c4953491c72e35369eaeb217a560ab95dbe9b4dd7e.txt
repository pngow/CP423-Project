Indonesia emerged best choice.
Southeast Asia already home thriving fintech scene, Grab, GoTo Sea built super apps encompass financial services, startups like Xendit, Akulaku Dana (to name few) raised hundreds millions dollars payments, banking services financial tools. Indonesia Malaysia, heart Southeast Asia, among countries largest Muslim populations world.
factors proving fertile ground establishing growing fintechs focus exclusively Islamic finance, offering products services follow shariah law. Among things, forbids accruing interest, speculation financing non-halal products like pork, tobacco alcohol.
According World Bank, Indonesia Islamic fintech companies world – perhaps fitting, since it’s also populous Muslim-majority country world 231 million Muslims.
notable Islamic fintech companies include peer-to-peer lending platform digital bank Hijra (formerly known Alami), online bank Bank Aladin, LinkAja, backed Telkomsel Bank Mandri, largest bank Indonesia terms asset loans deposits.

Shariah law calls different approach financial services, conventional banks also launching products Muslim customers. Along growing number Islamic fintech startups digitizing process, Islamic-compliant services becoming accessible people.
Profit sharing instead debt
seed Blossom Finance planted Martin running project U.S. enabling people buy Bitcoin. ran receivables problem, usual way finance cash receivables get line credit receivables financing bank. practicing Muslim, however, Martin couldn’t use conventional loans. also couldn’t find options U.S.
“Quite naively, thought plenty Muslims businesses, surely face problem,” said. “They must solution. solution?”
learning principles Islamic finance, Martin launched Blossom Finance, platform connects investors microbanks, turn disburse shariah-compliant financing microbusinesses. Headquartered Delaware, Blossom Finance hosts investors primarily United States Europe, microbusinesses serves Indonesia.
initially soft-launching U.S., Blossom Finance team realized market Islamic finance small, said Martin. started looking bigger market, landed Indonesia financial inclusion challenges facing micro small businesses.
reasons Blossom Finance chose Indonesia countries large Muslim populations included relative political stability, Martin said. also strong baseline infrastructure operating businesses primarily foreign capital.
“There’s already past two decades prior us arriving tons amazing work,” Martin said. “A lot groundwork already able come operate connector inefficiencies, lack capital. able bridge lack capital using technology solution. underlying infrastructure last mile serving microbusinesses already able tap it.”
Investors Blossom Finance’s platform pool money funds, cooperatives, managed microbanks. microbanks disburse financing microbusinesses purchase inventory things need. losses profits shared pro rata, Martin explained. investor’s capital 1% fund, expect receive 1% profits, absorb losses rate.
makes Blossom Finance’s microfinance platform shariah-compliant use murabaha contracts instead traditional interest-charging loans. example, microbusiness, like corner store, needs buy inventory like beverages snacks, go one cooperatives financing. Martin explains basis financing capital, commodity needs purchased. cooperative purchases wholesale prices provides business markup instead charging interest. share profit investors. Martin said cooperatives often connect microbusinesses wholesalers didn’t previously know, also benefit economies scale, also helps microbusinesses.

Cooperatives don’t set prices, instead mudarabah agreements based current market prices, microbusinesses agree to. make sure microbusinesses get fair agreements microbanks, cost funding microbusinesses one things Blossom Finance takes consideration deciding whether work cooperative/microbank.
“Let’s say you’re bank want buy chickens. agree buy 100 chickens. Let’s say costs $1,000. agree profit 20%, pay $1,200 course of, say, 12 months. financier 20% profit,” Martin said.
advantage working cooperatives instead commercial banks provide flexible payment terms financing tenure, helpful business runs financial difficulty, Martin added.
Martin said discussion among Islamic scholars whether profit-sharing inherently better debt. But, asks, “if equity debt equal, Prophet Muhammed prayed protection debt? think inherently know answer question, debt trap poor cycle poverty cannot escape. Equity, hand, involves concept risk participation. Investors hopefully better upside, reason get better upside they’re participating equally entrepreneur terms risk.”
Fostering financial inclusion
2022 report research firm DinarStandard fintech Ellipses estimates market size Islamic fintech Organisation Islamic Coorporation (OIC) countries $79 billion 2021, making 0.83% global fintech transaction volume. Islamic fintech’s market size still small, expected reach $179 billion 17.9% CAGR 2026, outpacing traditional fintech’s 13.5% CAGR growth period.
DinarStandard Ellipses also found 375 Islamic fintech companies around world. P2P financing space, Indonesia one top markets transaction volume.
Islamic fintech startups Malaysia Indonesia support government policies. example, Indonesia’s National Islamic Finance Committee focused developing Islamic finance country’s Islamic economy.
Malaysia, Bank Negara’s Investments Accounts Platform first Islamic P2P initiative established central bank, government-owned Malaysia Digital Economy Corporation connects investors halal business owners. 2019, Malaysian government also issued Shared Prosperity Vision 2030, 10-year framework restructuring economy includes building Islamic fintech hub key part strategy.
example, one group people reach avoid bank accounts terms shariah-compliant, want usury-free financial transactions based risk-sharing. Islamic fintech also help resolve issues unbanked people face, like lack money, lack proper documentation located far away conventional Islamic banks.
“Islamic banks extraordinarily conservative, operate, cost financing, lend to, etc.,” said. “Having companies differentiate provide nice consumer experience digital banking side, within framework Islamic bank, there’s opportunity there.”
World Bank also says Islamic microfinancing, short-term financing terms less 12 months, play important role alleviating poverty OIC countries since work customers often underserved traditional banks.
One example fintech company creating shariah-compliant products underserved customers Funding Societies, headquartered Singapore operations Indonesia, Malaysia Thailand Vietnam.
Kien Poon Chai, country manager Funding Societies Malaysia, said shariah-compliant financing product launched 2022 serve relatively new micro- small businesses, usually overlooked banks seeking working capital.
Chai said impetus launching shariah-compliant financing products Malaysia large Muslim population company seeing demand lenders SMEs looking financing products line faith.
Funding Societies underwrites shariah-compliant financing product way conventional financing counterparts, several nuances pay close attention to. example, financing cannot used non-halal businesses, including ones sell alcohol, pork, tobacco massage houses.
Financial offers also backed underlying assets, every disbursement Funding Societies makes shariah-compliant product, purchase underlying commodities exchanges.
Fee disclosures charges also shariah-compliant. cannot uncertainty financing products, fees charges must clearly defined outlined. example, penalizing people early repayment prepayment fees forbidden.
Peer-to-peer lending without interest
Another Islamic startup focused financial inclusion P2P lending platform neobank Hijra. Founded 2018, Hijra raised $30 million equity investors like Quona Capital, Golden Gate Ventures EV Growth. first started aggregator traditional Islamic banks serving SMEs, co-founder CEO Dima Djani told TechCrunch 9 months, team realized Islamic banking industry Indonesia couldn’t keep growth fintech.
result, Hijra got licensed Indonesia’s Financial Services Authority (OJK) 2019 operate digital lending platform. retail lenders began asking comprehensive financial services, Hijra, known Alami (which still name P2P lending platform) acquired small Islamic bank last year launched new digital bank savings accounts money transfers.
main reason Djani wanted launch Islamic finance platform Indonesia one largest Muslim populations world, penetration Islamic finance still low, 6% 7% total banking assets, compared 30% penetration Malaysia. Djani attributes low consumer awareness Islamic finance, says new wave religious teachers, gain followers social media, given rise strong halal economy last 10 years also spurred interest among millennial Gen Z Muslims adopting services tailored faith.
Indonesia, guidelines Islamic finance determined three authorities, said researcher Fahmi Ali Hadaefi. Financial Services Authority (OJK), regulates supervises financial services sector, Bank Indonesia, oversees banks, Majelis Ulama Indonesia (National Sharia Board-MUI), country’s leading Islamic scholars body.
MUI published least two fatwas fintech. first, issued 2017, Islamic perspectives practices related e-money. second one, issued year later Financial Services Authority, covers Islamic fundamentals P2P lending.
Since Muslims prohibited interest-bearing transactions, Hijra’s team wanted provide alternative users need working capital financing. Like Blossom Finance, uses profit-sharing model avoid interest.
way handles P2P loans lenders farmers one example. fish farmer needs buy feed, don’t take loan interest lender. Instead, lender buys fish feed sells profit farmer, markups based current market rates. Instead paying feed immediately, farmers pay harvesting fish three four months.
Islamic finance meant create transparent fair financial service everyone,” said Djani. “For example, view interest usury unfair instrument mechanics. addition, also view speculation gambling unfair, commensurate effort return evenly.”
Hijra’s digital banking app, able launch acquiring small Islamic bank Jakarta, doesn’t give yield depositors moment, also doesn’t charge fees. future, Hijra planning launch sharia-compliant financial solutions, like rent-to-own, payments community-driven savings groups people common goal, like saving money trip Mecca.
Building halal payment gateway
Another example company founded get Muslims participating digital financial services PayHalal, created provide shariah-compliant online payment gateway.
Co-founder Pat Salam Thevarajah told TechCrunch fellow PayHalal co-founders realized 2016 wanted get people Muslim community adopt online payments, would build entire tech stack ground up, instead going white-label provider like Ayden. Thevarajah said 55% Malaysian population unbanked primarily fear riba, interest.
“We built pure necessity create end-to-end compliance transaction. That’s PayHalal came about. primary objective keep payment free riba gharar, speculation, Muslims able perform electronic payments person e-commerce without form non-compliance.”
One PayHalal’s goals create network like Visa Mastercard stays true Islamic finance principles. One key difference lack interest.
Conventional payment gateways treat money commodity, means sold price higher face value lent interest. PayHalal treat money commodity, instead using purchase goods services, makes profit trading goods services. PayHalal makes sure services shariah-compliant help two team members, scholar Dr. Daud Bakar co-founder Indrawathi Selvarajah, corporate lawyer became shariah fintech specialist.
Right now, instrument comes conventional financial institution, PayHalal feeds AI-based non-shariah compliance screening tool. tool suggests treatment based amount non-compliance factor, PayHalal says takes fee earns transaction, writes contributes social work, like feeding poor people building mosques, part process called purification.
Thevarajah said process auditable Islamic financial institutions internal shariah compliance departments, turn undergo regular audits external shariah supervisory boards. process identifying non-compliant transactions, writing profits donating fees documented reviewed internal external auditors accuracy.
examples shariah non-compliant transactions include ones involve sale forbidden items like alcohol, tobacco pork. Transactions involve riba gharar also considered non-compliant, include interest charged late payments uncertain terms used sales contracts.
“There guarantee keep riba away, unless it’s closed-loop Islamic transaction,” said Thevarajah. “If becomes open-loop transaction, required purification.”
Cases non-compliant transactions tries avoid include exchange goods consumption aren’t made halal ingredients. Another cases salaam contracts, buyer pays immediately something delivered later date. kind transaction handled PayHalal, mitigates chargebacks making sure customers get goods agreed upon time.
One PayHalal’s goals build super app different shariah-compliant financial services, like insurance products saving accounts pilgrimages Mecca. recently took step toward expanding product portfolio launching shariah-compliant buy now, pay later service Atome. BNPL program interest-free annual servicing fees. currently onboarding merchants offer halal shariah-compliant services products.

Thevarajah explains customer defaults beyond three-month term loan, PayHalal can’t charge interest. Instead, underwrite entire transaction. “Our contract merchant would active participation buy product resell consumer consideration fee,” said, adding “The contract changes entire structure Islamic buy now, pay later operates.”
Thevarajah added transactions structured deferred payment sales, means PayHalal, acting seller, buys product supplier sells customer profit margin. customer pays total price product installments predetermined period time. transaction asset-based, means secured product sold, buyer’s creditworthiness.
Still early days
rise Islamic fintech markets like Indonesia Malaysia tied growth Islamic finance Southeast Asia. According S&P report published last year, Southeast Asia’s $290 billion Islamic banking market expected continue growing CAGR 8%. Malaysia, Islamic banks make 45% overall commercial banking loan book end 2025, Indonesia, Islamic finance’s market share expected grow 10% end 2026, faster rate conventional banks.
Islamic fintech still makes small percentage total market. stated earlier, DinarStandard Ellipses estimate market size Islamic fintech OIC countries $79 billion 2021, 0.83% global fintech transaction volume. that’s stopping Hijra making international expansion plans—the team already eye Malaysia, Turkey Saudi Arabia.
Golden Gate’s Justin Hall, also investor Hijra Funding Societies, believes Indonesia uniquely positioned starting ground Islamic banks expand markets around world.
“Indonesia country today confluence operators understand Islamic banking, well serial entrepreneurs, institutional LPs willing capitalize companies that, very, large domestic market. It’s rare find model unique Southeast Asia go global actually don’t know Islamic fintech.”
Muslim fintechs create inclusive market landscape Muslim users, also working inclusivity issues, getting women field financial technology businesses.
Djani said rate women working Muslim fintech still comparatively low, though promoted women leadership roles, including Hijra’s chief financial officer Febriny Rimenta.
One co-founders PayHalal, Selvarajah, woman Thevarajah said Muslim fintech startups take several steps get women space, including building gender-inclusive workplace based Islamic values, providing flexible working arrangements, mentorship promoting transparency build trust women employees.
added Muslim fintech startups design products, including savings investment platforms, increase women’s financial empowerment.
Martin said cooperatives Blossom Finance works typically high representation women, one staffed completely women.
Barriers exist aspects space, too. fundraising front, Martin said one main obstacles faced U.S. educating investors.
“First explain Islam say even problem, explain situation. challenge. However, would say VCs able connect dots understand genuine problem—there say, ok, maybe niche passed—but able take time understand problem, didn’t face barriers.”
Perhaps surprisingly, pushback got Muslims.
“Where face barriers within Muslims living minority America. pushed back against: ‘why calling Muslim? focused Islam?’” said. “Very interestingly, venture capital investors [who back us] like, makes sense. important niche. think goes back minority post-9/11, defensive. resistance versus going Muslim-majority [market], it’s like “well course you’re Muslim finance, wouldn’t you?”
Islamic fintechs, finding investors also mean due diligence.
PayHalal, received $4.5 million seed funding Asad Capital, Q Cap, Effective Shields Crescent Capital, process raising $5 million Series round valuation $33.5 million. Thevarajah said part fundraising means assessing potential investors ensure fund management done alignment shariah principles.
“Investor interest Islamic fintech sector PayHalal high due potential fast-growing Muslim population worldwide,” Thevarajah said. “While investors viewed captive market due religious beliefs Muslim community regarding halal food transactions, still ensure potential investors fell within fit proper category Islamic financial services.”
Founders countries large Muslim populations say also educate investors, changing. $30 million Hijra raised equity far almost non-Muslim countries. Djani said several investors already strong interest Islamic financial services growing niche able provide differentiation fintech players.
“We need education offering, dramatically less past years Islamic finance become mainstream widely accepted Muslim-majority countries, like Indonesia,” said.
