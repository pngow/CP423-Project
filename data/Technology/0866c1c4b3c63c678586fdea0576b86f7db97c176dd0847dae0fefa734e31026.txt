uncanny ability hold conversation, answer questions, write coherent prose, poetry, code, chatbot ChatGPT forced many people rethink potential artificial intelligence.
startup made ChatGPT, OpenAI, today announced much-anticipated new version AI model core.
new algorithm, called GPT-4, follows GPT-3, groundbreaking text-generation model OpenAI announced 2020, later adapted create ChatGPT last year.
new model scores highly range tests designed measure intelligence knowledge humans machines, OpenAI says. also makes fewer blunders respond images well text.
However, GPT-4 suffers problems bedeviled ChatGPT cause AI experts skeptical usefulness—including tendencies “hallucinate” incorrect information, exhibit problematic social biases, misbehave assume disturbing personas given “adversarial” prompt.
“While they’ve made lot progress, it’s clearly trustworthy,” says Oren Etzioni, professor emeritus University Washington founding CEO Allen Institute AI. “It’s going long time want GPT run nuclear power plant.”
OpenAI provided several demos data benchmarking tests show GPT-4’s capabilities. new model beat passing score Uniform Bar Examination, used qualify lawyers many US states, got score top 10 percent humans.
also scores highly GPT-3 exams designed test knowledge reasoning, subjects including biology, art history, calculus. gets better marks AI language model tests designed computer scientists gauge progress algorithms. “In ways it’s same,” Etzioni says. “But it’s absolutely mind-blowing series advances.”
GPT-4 also perform neat tricks seen GPT-3 ChatGPT, like summarizing suggesting edits pieces text. also things predecessors could not, including acting Socratic tutor helps guide students toward correct answers discussing contents photographs. example, provided photo ingredients kitchen counter, GPT-4 suggest appropriate recipe. provided chart, explain conclusions drawn it.
“It definitely seems gained abilities,” says Vincent Conitzer, professor CMU specializes AI begun experimenting new language model. says still makes errors, suggesting nonsensical directions presenting fake mathematical proofs.
ChatGPT caught public’s attention stunning ability tackle many complex questions tasks via easy-to-use conversational interface. chatbot understand world humans responds words statistically predicts follow question.
underlying mechanism also means ChatGPT systems like often make facts. despite OpenAI’s efforts make model resistant abuse, prompted misbehaving, example suggesting role-play something refuses asked directly. OpenAI says GPT-4 40 percent likely provide “factual responses” says GPT-4 82 percent less likely respond requests disallowed. company say often previous version, GPT-3, provides factually incorrect responses responds requests reject.
Still, Ilya Sutskever, cofounder chief scientist OpenAI, claims perhaps significant advances new model. “The thing stands way ChatGPT really useful many people many tasks reliability,” says. “GPT-4 yet, lot closer.”
Conitzer CMU says GPT-4 appears include new guardrails prevent generating undesirable responses adds new capabilities may lead new ways exploiting it.
arrival GPT-4 long anticipated tech circles, including vigorous meme-making unreleased software’s potential powers. arrives heady moment tech industry, jolted arrival ChatGPT renewed expectation new era computing powered AI.
furor around chatbot also stoked interest new startups building using similar AI technology left companies feeling flat-footed. Google, spent years investing AI research invented key algorithms used build GPT ChatGPT, scrambling catch up. OpenAI’s research paper GPT-4 discloses details GPT-4 built works, citing competition around new AI tools well risks pose.
OpenAI says version ChatGPT uses GPT-4 available paid users chatbot, company gradually make new language model available API.
capabilities ChatGPT similar AI programs stirred debate around AI may automate revolutionize office jobs. advanced iterations may able take new skills. However, Etzioni keen emphasize that—impressive though GPT-4 is—there still countless things humans take granted cannot do. “We remember that, however eloquent ChatGPT is, still chatbot,” says.
