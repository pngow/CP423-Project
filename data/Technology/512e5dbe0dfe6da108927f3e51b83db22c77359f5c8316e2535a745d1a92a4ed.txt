Consider
Shopping Power Banks
things worth thinking you’re shopping portable charger.
Capacity: capacity power bank measured milliampere-hours (mAh), little misleading amount power get depends cable use, device charging, charging method (Qi wireless charging less efficient). never get maximum capacity. try provide estimate you’ll get terms charges devices.
Charging speeds standards: charging rate devices like smartphones measured watts (W), power banks list voltage (V) amperage (A). Thankfully, calculate wattage simply multiplying voltage amperage. Unfortunately, getting maximum rate also depends device, standards supports, charging cable use. Many smartphones, including Apple’s iPhones, support Power Delivery (PD) standard, meaning use higher-power power banks recharge device issues. phones, Samsung’s Galaxy range, support supplementary PD protocol called PPS (Programmable Power Standard) goes 45 W. Many phones also support Qualcomm’s proprietary Quick Charge (QC) standard. also proprietary fast-charging standards, won’t generally find power banks support unless come smartphone manufacturer.
Pass-through: want charge power bank use charge another device simultaneously, need pass-through support. Nimble, GoalZero, Elecjet, Biolite, Mophie, Zendure, Shargeek portable chargers listed support pass-through charging. Anker discontinued support pass-through found differences output wall charger input device charging cause power bank cycle rapidly shorten lifespan. would advise caution using pass-through, also cause portable chargers heat up.
Travel: It’s safe travel power bank, two restrictions keep mind board flight: must portable charger carry-on luggage (it cannot checked in), must exceed 100 Wh (watt-hours). power bank larger capacity 27,000 mAh, check airline. problem.

Charging take while, particularly using solar panels (sold separately), took day half. strongly suggest least 200 watts worth panels.
Best Going Off-Grid
headed still need power, going want solar panel. plenty portable panels, garbage. Even luck good one reputable brand, making sure enough incoming energy charge battery connecting everything proper charge controller gets complicated—which love Lightsaver Max. compact, durable, rollable solar panel battery, one unit. genius, wish I'd one back lived RV.
solar panels waterproof made marine-grade connectors, they'll stand anything. package rolls size large Maglite flashlight weighs 1.5 pounds. 60-Wh battery charge phones least three times need recharge it. solar panel recharge battery six eight hours full sun ideal conditions. real-world conditions—for example, strapped top pack canoeing—it fully recharged day. certainly charged enough keep devices topped up. Plug wall it'll recharged 3.5 hours. price Max high, there's also smaller Lightsaver, $219 ($220 Amazon) features 3,200-mAh battery lacks waterproof panel. Still, backpacking, 5-ounce weight much appealing.
Note: frequently stock due chip shortage, smaller size usually available. can't wait, PowerFilm Solar also offer wide range rollable foldable solar panels.
Best Car
It’s horrible feeling car refuses start battery dead, portable battery pack like one trunk, give jump-start.

Avoid Cheap Stuff
Battery Safety
Many years ago, Samsung Galaxy Note 7 gained notoriety batteries caught fire series incidents. There's steady stream similar, though isolated, incidents ever since. However, despite high-profile coverage batteries gone wrong, vast majority Li-ion batteries safe.
chemical reaction occurs inside lithium-ion cell complex, battery, there's negative positive electrode. lithium batteries, negative lithium-carbon compound, positive cobalt oxide (though many battery makers moving away cobalt). two compounds cause reaction safe controlled delivers energy devices. reaction gets control though, end earbuds melting ears. changes safe reaction uncontrolled reaction number things: excess heat, physical damage use, physical damage manufacture, using wrong charger.
three basic rules kept safe (thus far) testing dozens dozens batteries are:
Avoiding cheap wall-outlet adapters, cords, chargers important. likely source problems. chargers see Amazon $20 cheaper competition? worth it. probably got price skimping insulation, leaving power-management tools, ignoring basics electrical safety. Price alone guarantee safety, either. Buy reputable companies brands.
there's heat. much cause manner problems, terms discharge terms safety. Avoid heat, pay attention batteries they're charging. device gets overly hot charging, sign problems. Similarly, beware swollen, bulging, otherwise misshapen batteries.
