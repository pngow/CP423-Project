Love Self-Emptying Bins
think robot vacuum working, first thing I'd suggest try emptying bin regularly. dragging dust balls around house instead picking up, probably enough room bin. reviewed Roomba S9+, predicted within years robot vacuums would self-emptying bin. future come pass, almost every manufacturer makes one.
