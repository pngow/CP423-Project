Since announced several years back, I’ve found Amazon’s Citadel conceptually interesting.
television marketplace international territories important ever landscape glutted IP-driven franchise plays, idea pre-franchising original idea instantly building brand fungibility different foreign spinoffs enticing, albeit meaninglessly jargon-filled.
course, it’s easy get conceptually interested something don’t know actual concept — seen half ended six-episode first season Citadel, say sustained interest harder come by.

“You can’t even remember put toilet seat down. you’re Jason Bourne?” asks Mason’s incredulous wife finds secret past. This, incidentally, horrible line dialogue.

Mostly, reflects desperate show make every line dialogue attempted banter.
Nobody Citadel actually talks individual voice. either attempt exchange witty quips unload long bursts exposition.
Occasionally witty quips aren’t bad, least they’re elevated actors roles.
