Corden launched would eventually become America’s foremost source watching famous people sing karaoke passenger seat, late-night talk show inflection point. year prior, Jimmy Fallon taken Tonight Show Jay Leno, who, legally obligated remind you, stole Conan O’Brien. time, Seth Meyers launched show Fallon’s former 12:30 a.m. spot. months Corden’s tenure began 2015, Jon Stewart left Daily Show, replaced Trevor Noah. time new guard taking format, also time bunch white guys left, replaced (mostly) white guys.
Eight years later, Corden heads air back England late-night talk show genre seems closer potential extinction ever has, feels like may another inflection point. seemed appropriate emergency discussion Bethy Squires, author Vulture’s “This Week Late Night” column, TV critic Jen Chaney Corden’s likability legacy, late night goes here.
Bethy Squires: come bury James Corden, praise him. Well, I’m praise little. I’m sad see show go. time slot late night, Late Late Show James Corden. “This Week Late Night” column, watch every late-night show, way riffed staff lockdown era genuine highlight. I’m curious thought Corden, especially pre-pandemic, caught lot less of.
space clearly tight proper late-night show, something fun DIY episode gave early David Letterman vibes combined heavy dose Graham Norton. episode in-studio ones, Corden committed putting guests together sofa, one things always made Norton’s U.K. show fun hang generally worked Corden, too. liked Corden experimenting form improvising bit. show went on, became known bits — “Carpool Karaoke” segments “Crosswalk Musical” performances — improvisational qualities. biggest knock Corden, actually, show didn’t feel improvised all, instead like series highly choreographed set pieces designed make celeb guests seem relatable showcase Corden’s talents U.K.’s No. 1 Thirstiest Theater Kid.
thing is, that’s sort promised CBS executives would do. interview earlier week CBS Sunday Morning, Corden recalled feedback gave CBS asked time slot belonged Craig Ferguson. “I said think you’ve got opportunity hour embraces internet,” said. “Make show launches 12:37 people consume watch day, that’s audience consuming content now.” song-and-dance fests sketches often go viral, make strong argument succeeded mission. he, along Jimmy Fallon, also pushed late night direction carefully orchestrated “spontaneity” replaced actual spontaneity. miss real thing, least felt like real thing. miss one time Beck played “Country Down” dining room.
BS: That’s frustrating thing watching Corden comedy fan: seeing genuine moments spontaneity crowded splashy, prerecorded stuff. that’s definitely he’s well known world large.
want go back time U.K. panel-show trenches. Big Fat Quiz fan, that’s first knew him. Corden often paired Jack Whitehall (who frequent guest Late Late Show), two would brats episode. Big Fat Quiz Yearis pub-quiz-style show comes Christmas every year Channel 4. Teams celebs compete see knows past year, really they’re competing see make jokes host Jimmy Carr’s style, tax evasion, hair plugs. One better bits show ever Whitehall Corden (1) showed tuxes demonstrate weren’t fuck around, (2) ordered pizza.
stunt highlights Corden’s greatest strength biggest flaw rolled one. He’s afraid play heel comedy requires it. way Whitehall pester panelists high school: annoying yet funny time. commitment preplanned bits also there. time Corden got Late Late Show, U.K. comedy nerds like, “Good, he’s problem now.”
Let’s talk Fallon YouTube-ified late night. There’s obvious point two utilize recurring segments (“Carpool Karaoke,” “Go On, Git,” etc.) consumed stand-alone content, completely divorced concept “late night.” Corden also pretapes lot things seemingly don’t need pretaped. big guest, they’ll couch one night show sketch/song/”Crosswalk Musical” later week. doesn’t even try make viewer believe things happening night.
feel un-temporality late night today? one hand, ain’t way I’m going stay late watch show network broadcast. hand, can’t help feel like we’re losing something ineffable decoupling late night actually late night.
JC: something fact shows meant watched bed — people days streaming, internet, DVRs — helped define sensibilities. monologues interviews host guests really main event, meant chatty fun, provide good laughs drowsiness kicked in.
Even guests prepped ahead time, still sense spontaneity lot late-night conversations, sense surprising things could happen weren’t control host publicists micromanaging clients. one example many: Cher telling Letterman asshole national television 1986. Generally days, things didn’t feel quite overtly scripted. Certainly Letterman, Leno, Conan sketches; Conan particular gift, 12:30 heyday, weirding masturbating bears pimp bots, which, again, suited audience (mostly) younger people late mood something punchy.
Corden correct recognize mid-2000s, people longer consuming “late night” late night anymore. also smart think show might work YouTube era. focus games silly sketches, Late Late Show elsewhere, wound pushing late night original principles. Instead creating relaxing, organically evolving experience anything could seemingly happen, Corden (and Fallon) started forcing “the anything” happen. Corden especially earned reputation try-hard (among things). Like, watch try cringe. can’t done. reputation tough shake, mainly it’s accurate, although necessarily always bad thing.
BS: There’s something friend’s ex-boyfriend said stuck much longer relationship, “You can’t force jam.” think context making fun Phish something, definitely applies here. Fallon Corden guilty trying force jam, way “Day Drinking Seth” never does. Colbert’s audience often forces jam upon him, chanting booing.
Corden try-hard, American allergy people making effort one cuter attributes. sort sympathize, person whose job security often depends interview going well. Would loosey-goosey, discursive late-night conversations happen Charli D’Amelio? Celebs media-trained nowadays. wonder try-hard way pierce PR veil. can’t get call asshole dance desk, get eat bull testicles. It’s fitting one Corden’s signature guests Kim Kardashian, made fortune overproduced version “reality.”
Speaking frequent Corden guests, think it’s responsibility force talk Harry Styles.
JC: That’s right, talk Harry Styles forced. “forced,” mean someone comes says, “Hi.”
He’s great example celebrity really popped Late Late Show, testament much charm Corden’s segments could turn based famous person them. Styles’s bits worked well part generally low-key, created nice contrast Corden. 2019 “Concert Crosswalk” segment lot fun part Harry seems dismissive whole concept. recent making video “Daylight” $300 also fun harked back seat-of-the-pants style display aforementioned episode Tommy’s house.
Whenever Corden paired Tom Cruise daredevil stunt, like jumping plane, also fascinating, Cruise maybe person earth “doing most” flagrantly Corden.
But, Bethy, you’ve watching Late Late Show past couple years much regularly have. forcing jam abated all?
BS: Gonna first sidebar “Daylight” music-video shoot. think Making Video energy hooks millennial, also impish-little-shit energy coming Corden. think makes Corden’s trying palatable knows it’s annoying. knows he’s extra, he’s excited annoy Styles even girls live apartment. Lean brand, guy!
answer question, time jam coming unforced, show couldn’t real audience. Maybe it’s theater kid Corden, always overplays studio audience. audiences verboten COVID 2021, Corden chillest hang late-night shows. whole staff, including senior VP late-night television, West Coast, Nick Bernstein, forced participate monologues. like Soup, crew laughing behind camera.
Corden wisely opened monologue space, turning dialogue head writer Ian Karmel, Reggie Watts band, camera guys, writers, everybody. Show show, crew’s personas built up, well Corden’s specific vibe each. Cameraman Pete Parrot Head; band weird sex stuff; Nick Bernstein horse racing. also change monologues edited, making looser preserving pre-joke patter. years pre-COVID turning late night YouTube, lockdown-era Late Late Show turned late night podcasts. It’s frustrating seeing show devolve back scripted jokes things opened back up.
good example show like podcast era week Bernstein given chair weirdly high. Then, next nights, chair would get higher higher. Silly! Pointless! Mild bullying! Late Late Show (and CBS exec) height.
JC: First all, wish watched Corden quarantine era. fact, hopeful stripped-down nature late night forced become COVID might usher chaos energy form. like said, everything slid right back normal.
far late night’s days numbered, don’t think it’s immediately going away. Colbert’s contract CBS expires next year, Jimmys — Fallon Kimmel — years left theirs. think fewer people engage late-night talk shows Corden arrived scene. people want hear celebrities, generally follow Instagram TikTok, want fun host-celeb banter, go shows like Hot Ones Chicken Shop Date.
Personally, still value late-night talk shows. Like you, moments generated shows things often return I’m looking pick-me-up YouTube clip. would like see different voices leading way — put Ziwe Corden’s old slot, cowards! — fearlessness terms subverting genre trying new things. I’m saying want Tonight Show turn Eric Andre Show. I’m also saying that.
someone studied show, think Late Late Show remembered? remembered?
BS: think Corden’s legacy “Carpool Karaoke” Paul McCartney. Late-night careers often get condensed one two bits come represent host’s whole tenure: Carson tomahawk, Letterman Drew Barrymore, Conan’s remote segments. think Corden remembered “Carpool Karaoke” beating Nanette Homecoming Emmy, think people unfortunately think like Crash beat Brokeback Mountain.
hope people remember Late Late Show things expand boundaries late night. First, Corden’s immediate predecessor Craig Ferguson bringing gonzo energy monologues really exploring space. Then, Corden’s willingness take show studio. Sure, impulse block traffic Corden dressed mouse. also gave one random guy personal Beck concert. Trying hard place.
