Prepare Eat Little Mermaid Cast
Disney’s new character posters upcoming live-action adaptation 1989 classic Little Mermaid don’t look — oh, what’s word? — good. animal characters particular upsetting. adorable, expressive, merchandisable features, look like poorly rendered graphics Animal Planet daytime-filler programming. Sebastian mouth, yet must scream. Flotsam Jetsam belong deep-sea part aquarium God’s wretched creatures go. imagine version Flounder probably great children’s focus groups … children haunted dolls.
One character didn’t get poster Chef Louis, sings murderous anthem ways he’s going kill cook “Les Poissons.” new versions characters deserve death possess souls, take inspiration Louis decide would eat given chance.

fear age. Experts say meat older crabs may emit slight ammonia smell, taste delicious same. crustacean iconic Sebastian, two directions strike sufficiently honorable. First, finest crab recipe planet: Singaporean chile crab. Shallot, ginger, chiles, fermented yellow-soybean paste, dried shrimp paste, ketchup, sweet chile sauce, scallions, cilantro, etc. etc., smothering little dude heavy wok extreme heat. problem loud cooking process be, spatula clanging steel. want let Sebastian sing he’s prepared. So, second option, might suggest simple crab boil, slowly lowering guy bubbling liquid croons last tune. spicy sea, baby. —Nick Quah

interest preserving much Flounder’s character dignity possible, recommendation prepare serve whole. It’s important capture essential qualities ingredient, essential quality “CGI fish face designed communicate bare minimum human expression,” careful keep whole head cooking process. Beyond that, possible routes: Score skin broil you’re focused crispy flounder skin, stuff roast you’re excited tender flounder flesh. I’m personally roasting model, preference would stuff Flounder’s insides lemon, garlic, many fresh herbs cram — dill classic, combination like work — roast baking sheet. wanted get fancy, though, could throw Sebastian double-seafood treat! —Kathryn VanArendonk
Scuttle

working wildfowl, many chefs recommend hanging unplucked bird 50 55 degrees days develop flavors. However, accounts, seabird meat already features almost overwhelming taste ocean. Per Kate Erbland Scuttle gannet cormorant; either way, let’s treat seabird way Faroe Islanders do. First, behead Scuttle, rip insides. Pluck feathers remove wings feet. According 19th-century cookbook, gulls soaked saltwater eight hours remove fishy scent. Since Scuttle probably rather lean compared fulmars Faroes, we’ll next boil rather roasting her, throwing stockpot aromatics. We’ll need rich accompaniment, make jus wings feet serve side mashed potatoes. Eat Scuttle alongside bottle schnapps want true Føroyingar. —Nate Jones
Flotsam Jetsam

Apparently, moray eels carry risk ciguatera poisoning, among things causes vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness — nefarious development you’d expect villainous hench-fish. said, ciguatera tropical phenom, setting Little Mermaid source much debate, fairy-tale author Hans Christian Andersen Denmark, let’s assume Flotsam Jetsam good go. personally find eel tasty grilled Japanese style, given F J baddies, deserve fate worthy wickedness, end English cuisine. Time jelly toothy fuckers, boiling vinegar natural gelatinous qualities create, cooled, goo cooked pieces suspended in. course, someone eat concoction, that’s price evil (and looking delicious). —Alison Willmore
Ursula
world Little Mermaid, expressionless CGI fish sentient semi-human-looking creature fathoms below. Two-time Academy Award nominee Booking.com spokeswoman Melissa McCarthy exempt that. spoiler alert movie that’s almost old enough president: Ursula gets fried end anyway, eating really “waste not, want not” situation. colleagues suggested prepared calamari style, character poster, tentacles really reminiscent octopus. presents rare opportunity: guilt-free octopus. Many people swear octopus either animal’s high intelligence they’re weird South African guy who’s married one. Ursula huge asshole, eating actually good deed. Prepare multiple ways: takoyaki balls, grilled pulpo served patatas bravas, tinned Portuguese style Eric’s sailor buddies. I’m going suggest eat top half — I’m monster — might well use chum. sing supper! —Rebecca Alter
