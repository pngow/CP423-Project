Late Late Show Stand-up Hot Spot
Late-night stand-up spots longer guaranteed career catapults were. Long gone days Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, young comedian could go relative unknown future sitcom star overnight great five-minute set. prestige opportunities remains. They’re recognizable credits help comedians get booked clubs festivals, impressive clips circulate online build fan base offer lifelong bragging rights. They’re also disappearing: Since start 2023, 25 stand-up-comedy sets across five major U.S. late-night shows — one Late Night Seth Meyers, 12 Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, 12 Late Late Show James Corden. latter shows coming end April 27, trend poised get worse.
Known star-studded segments like “Carpool Karaoke,” legacy Late Late Show James Corden unlikely tied stand-up featured. program, aired 105 stand-up sets course run 2015 2023 — nearly third marked emerging comedians’ late-night debuts — made indelible impact scene. early showcase talent Jacqueline Novak received national attention Off-Broadway show Get Knees. valuable American exposure popular British acts visiting U.K., James Acaster Romesh Ranganathan. show Maria Bamford delivered incredible eulogy late mother. live YouTube audiences discover revisit long CBS permits them.
man behind Ryan Williams, talent booker segment producer Late Late Show responsible booking comedians readying sets broadcast. previously worked similar roles Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon Late Show David Letterman, Williams brought experience Late Late Show 2015 develop show’s stand-up sensibility. challenge, according him, feature wide range comedic perspectives possible still appealing Corden’s not-necessarily-adventurous audience. often not, succeeded threading needle. Ahead show’s final episode, Williams spoke acts he’s proudest booking broader state stand-up late night.
coming Late Late Show, worked stand-up booker Letterman Fallon. approach differ here? one thing every late-night show common lot you’re tailored hosts’ taste. James came place wasn’t stand-up comedian. definitely tastes people loved, begin, pretty much showing American stand-ups James trying find people tickled fancy. time went on, able branch little. focused getting people late-night debuts highlighting really interesting points view.
booking process look like? submissions came via email people’s agents managers. lot times, I’d get referrals stand-ups who’d show. ones I’d get excited about. stand-up here, really well, clearly got about, I’d let know, “As you’re going world, keep mind. I’d love hear folks see ready solid sets.” Especially pre-COVID, clubs lot often now, trying go different industry showcases, dropping Hot Tub thing.
looking went submissions? It’s much balancing interesting point view also palatable mainstream audience. always tried keep mind folks showing watch late-night talk-show taping aren’t necessarily folks would show comedy club. would avoid challenging material, part, exceptions. always kept mind types opportunities pretty far between. could find somebody presented something unique exciting, was, general, direction liked go.
think back favorite sets booked show, comes mind? first one comes mind Jacqueline Novak, super-funny. think late-night debut here. one first creative bookings — someone going exciting, interesting points view, maybe people doesn’t necessarily fit standard, traditional late-night mold. really funny set gone great things.
Fabrizio Copano, recently — Chilean comedian. rep sent clip along, soon watched it, like, Wow, super-funny. goes back thing like, unique point view kind goes beyond jokes airplane food. something say think would worth putting television.
young comedians feel particularly proud early champion of? feel like got ground floor Atsuko Okatsuka train. incredible. another one moments watched clip got excited possibility putting person television. She’s got unique vibe — kind childlike innocence, really intelligent, cynical take wrapped it. thrilled late-night debut here, she’s gonna continue excel.
set thought, unique. can’t believe got put TV? I’m really proud Maria Bamford set year ago. got email original, focused mother passing away dealing grief charming way. that’s exactly type thing would normally try steer stand-up comedian away from. I’d say, “This incredible thoughtful brilliant, it’s maybe best fit audience.” kind gracious enough send another set wasn’t sort focused death morbidity, comparing two them, sort took wind sails. like, choice put really emotionally riveting set air, think try go it. time went around make sure everybody page.
Since then, sets would excited put television maybe little bit uncomfortable haven’t done. response Maria’s really strong positive, think kind gave us green light past year little bit daring folks booking.
Comedian Jena Friedman spoke recently set trying workshop show wearing baby onstage pull plug on. wondering wanted share side story. Jena person I’m huge fan of, saw book coming out, actually reached publicist say, “We receptive audience Jena would even consider putting together late-night set. realize might best fit might futile effort.” wanted attempt thread needle getting exciting voice wasn’t also going challenging audience. great experience working Jena, upfront whole time long shot would be. don’t think acrimony hard feelings. wasn’t pulled plug last minute. clear beginning going challenge might end big goose egg scoreboard.
Part job going sets word word prepare broadcast television. think example something absurd censor could air? You’re usually able find compromise comedian preserves integrity joke, definitely moments silliness. say “erection,” can’t say “hard.” It’s kind stuff, reason clinical, almost repulsive names things fine, whereas colloquial slang terms get shut Standards Practices. definitely really hilarious email exchanges Standards Practices going back forth different slang terms buttholes.

think late-night shows, exception Tonight Show﻿, scaled back booking comedians? you’re bringing stand-up show, you’re really farming five seven minutes someone else’s point view. that’s important you, see wouldn’t want give time someone else could creating content. us, really wanted make stand-up big part show. important us prioritize elevating outside voices. even production point view, stand-up valuable it’s basically filling act show writers don’t write anything, don’t pay $10,000 bring band. Ideally, you’ve got self-contained performer take pressure everything else five minutes so. seems silly people aren’t taking advantage that.
see stand-up late night going here? stand-up set late night specific animal. It’s almost like poem commencement speech, structured specific way you’ve got put lot time running get right. there’s something that’s archaic still allows people unique points view funny ways seeing world kind get out, think that’s great. I’m curious see going happen @midnight show. remember aired, put many hilarious people radar first time comedy fan, think opportunity again. @midnight able celebrate voices make people look good, could real revolution late-night comedy.
also, wants associated Twitter right now? don’t know they’re gonna bridge gap “@” symbol front name. really hope find creative way rise occasion, there’s huge amount talent that’s getting platform used have.
would summarize legacy Late Late Show? I’m really proud folks we’ve show. think comparison rest field, we’ve done really great job putting stand-up TV people excited about. funny Jim Gaffigan is, didn’t book 15 times stand-up like might’ve Letterman. really try find people expose new names audience celebrate many people possible. hope that’s we’re remembered for, anything.
