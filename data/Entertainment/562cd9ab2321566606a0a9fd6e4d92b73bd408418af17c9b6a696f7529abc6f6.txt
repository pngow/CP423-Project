John Mulaney’s John Mulaney Trap
Baby J, latest stand-up John Mulaney, herculean effort, exactly effort aims achieve entirely clear. highly public, intensely tumultuous past several years — intervention, long period rehab, divorce, sudden new relationship, new baby — special presentation comedian actor period attempt align person now. It’s designed self-examination: wants able laugh guy used audience laugh guy too. tries create lot space them. Mulaney addicted substances? He’s certainly related guy standing onstage, he’s quite same. He’s object held tut-tutted over, guy laugh safely longer exists.
distance past self necessary kind storytelling — without it, there’s rattling events room artistic transformation. Mulaney attacks Baby J less like product creative consideration he’s examining severed limb. entirely, confidently unruffled. sharp suit shiny dress shoes back; he’s big Boston Symphony Hall stage. Inside stories tells implication understand old-timey soft-shoe act always cover dark stuff. yes, maybe attempt reconcile Mulaney everyone knew onstage Mulaney lived behind scenes. act returned, time it’s fine! See, look — there’s much distance! laugh now! Except create much separation were, reconciliation starts look like dissociation.
Confessional comedy whole wing stand-up (going back least far Richard Pryor talking shooting wife’s car), it’s true amount distance key making story earlier guy funny. He’s present, emotions flaws visible. It’s isn’t funny yet, I’ll able laugh tomorrow codified art, gift audiences always get live “tomorrow.” sense, Baby J work crystal clarity. Present Mulaney captured Past Mulaney, packaged, polished, honed guy core qualities, shaping beautiful anecdotes look, summary, like personal disclosures. Detailed recovery retellings along mortifying story get cash buy drugs? way mezzanine, looks like vulnerability, baby!
seem Baby J’s ostensible intent. “The past couple years, I’ve done lot work myself,” Mulaney begins, “and I’ve realized I’ll fine long get constant attention.” intimate idea, realization fuels everything came Baby J everything work attempt unpack. placing opening, space usually throat-clearing, it’s though Mulaney voices attempts run far away possible. He’s hardly alone idea — James Acaster’s 2021 special plays it, it’s familiar Bo Burnham’s work (especially Kanye-inspired “Can’t Handle This” song). Mulaney even names Burnham Baby J, though tossed-off line kids prefer Burnham’s stuff “he’s currently less problematic.” special nearly hour half Mulaney voicing fundamental need driven career, describing incredible damage near catastrophe caused refusing explicitly connect ideas either past behavior current self.
special two components: “Baby J” Mulaney himself, invitation tenderness that’s also flippant piece ironic detachment finally arrives context joke. — trailer’s tagline, “a wide-ranging conversation” — works way. It’s tonal tip-off special meant grapple serious, darker thematic ideas — except tagline appears, it’s also Mulaney dunking low moment former self. hyperaware detachment constant. “I’ve weird couple years; you’ve weird couple years,” Mulaney says early breaking kind music-hall-style song dance: “You know mean / quarantined / went rehab got divorced reputation diff-rent!” funny, also sad, Mulaney seems desperate tap-dance sadness it. “Likability jail!” sings, miming doff hat.
launching bulk special, features celeb-studded intervention certainty would recognized rehab, Mulaney looks crowd, spots young kid one balconies, addresses stage. kid named Henry, he’s 11. crowd laughs uncomfortably, exactly tension Mulaney interested in: reputation comedian young Henry could enjoy; Mulaney explain that, actually, he’s someone else. Everyone gathered theater around screens knows they’ve come watch. clean man admits never clean. “Well, Henry,” Mulaney says, “if you’ve seen stand-up before, kind different vibe now. younger man, I’d come onstage like, ‘Hey! Ba ba ba ba-ba!’” Mulaney leaps around stage, making line sped-up vaudevillian patter emptied meaning. “And wonder caused that,” says audience laughs.
Except new vibe isn’t different. Sure, content changed. (There’s story coke one diaper-changing stations public restroom.) it’s though we’re supposed forget moments asking us reconsider rattling old-school prattle earlier specials, Mulaney exact thing, dancing across stage singing prison approval.
Baby J wears hard work sleeve, visible trap Mulaney doesn’t know evade — one might possible avoid anyone. come past years entirely different persona, wholly new Mulaney wears ratty T-shirts sits stool speaks endless, laughless minutes newfound sobriety sense self, line would old Mulaney gone audience missed him. Worse, could easily look like performance authenticity rather display vulnerability. instead particular frying pan, Mulaney jumped opposite direction ended fire anyhow, attempting disclose inner life instead making show divorcement it. moments, slight remove, Baby J appears excoriating act self-disclosure full details scenes abject emotional lows invite descriptions like brutal honest. close, though, looks like comedy special cannot help rebuild every single wall wants break down.
