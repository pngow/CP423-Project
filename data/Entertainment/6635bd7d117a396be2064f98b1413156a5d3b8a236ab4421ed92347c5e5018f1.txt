Butler 6 p.m. Greyhound bus Pittsburgh heading home Clarion Workshop science-fiction writers. felt proud past six weeks. turned 23, Clarion first time taken seriously writer. graduating high school, continued live home attending Pasadena City College. exhausted creative-writing classes extension classes UCLA, teacher asked her, “Can’t write anything normal?” got screenwriting class Open Door Workshop Writer’s Guild America, met writer Harlan Ellison. knew work well, particularly anthology Dangerous Visions, part literary, socially minded turn genre. later said “couldn’t write screenplays shit” knew talented encouraged go Clarion, even giving money.
Clarion farthest Butler ever home required three-day cross-country trip get there. Adjusting difficult first. Western Pennsylvania hot, humid, lonely. radio stations stopped playing eight. students socialized, wrote letters friends mother — six first week. Epistolary writing way unload unblock and, least Clarion, feel less isolated. “Write prove still Negroes somewhere world,” wrote mother early on. Ellison tell would one Black teacher there: Samuel Delany, 28 literary wunderkind. He’d published nine novels then, winning Nebula Award — field’s highest honor — Best Novel two years row. Butler saw first time, told looked like wild man Borneo. (She probably shouldn’t said that, thought later.) felt particularly hard herself, would write letters mother never sent. “I’m anything,” wrote. “I’m hiding blasted room crying you. disgusting.” mother forgone dental work Butler could attend. wouldn’t complain like that.
Yes, still shy. rarely spoke class, did, put hand mouth. (“She would never volunteer answer,” Delany recalled, “but whenever called her, always answer always smart.”) Ellison’s session shot arm. Butler hadn’t turned anything workshop, one-story-a-day gauntlet invigorated her. finished “Childfinder” 4 a.m. — story Black woman named Barbara ability locate children latent psionic abilities nurture them. sold story Ellison next anthology, Last Dangerous Visions, editor Doubleday encouraged send along book manuscript Psychogenesis, world building since teens.

high Clarion wore quickly. Ellison promised “Childfinder” would make Butler star, publication Last Dangerous Visions kept getting delayed. sent fragments Psychogenesis Diane Cleaver, Doubleday editor met workshop. Cleaver said promising would need complete manuscript. next five years, Butler didn’t sell writing wrote constantly. moved place Los Angeles, one side single-story duplex Mid City. Saturdays, packed draft Psychogenesis briefcase went library research. One day, lost briefcase department store; point on, always made backup copy work.
tried stick tight schedule. Every morning 2 a.m., woke write. best time, day filled people, mind could roam freely. Sunrise brought life ask for: menial jobs factories, offices, warehouses. subsisted work blue-collar temp agency called “the Slave Market.” mother wished would get full-time job secretary, Butler preferred manual labor didn’t “smile pretend good time.” body hurt; needed go dentist. took NoDoz stay awake day. always crunching numbers: price paper, far could stretch $99.07 biweekly paycheck. “Poverty constant, convenient, unfortunately valid excuse inaction,” wrote one journal entry.
world Psychogenesis psionics — telepathy, telekinesis, mind control — popular science fiction reading. possibility could control circumstances life mind held strong appeal Butler. believed real-world application, too. begun taking self-hypnosis classes back high school devoured self-help books like Magic Thinking Big 10 Days Great New Life. particularly loved Napoleon Hill’s Think Grow Rich, book motivational practices cribbed French psychologist Émile Coué’s concept optimistic auto-suggestion, originated mantra “In every day, every way, getting better better.” would learn manifest.
One Hill’s exercises go quiet spot write sum money want earn would get it. “faith.” stretch months 1970, Butler would follow instructions morning night. “Goal: own, free clear, $100,000 cash savings,” wrote. mantras sounded drumbeat throughout early journals. drew contracts writing benchmarks — put together outline; complete short story — signed “OEB.” copied Frank Herbert’s quote “Fear mind killer” wrote again, breaking stanzas. Writing incantation, spell could cast upon reader. “The goal right achieve scene pure emotion,” wrote. “I want feeling spark first sentence want reader, captive read helplessly hating vehemence interruption strong enough break them. shall succeed.”
Then, December 1975, 28, sold first book. losing Psychogenesis draft, began writing another novel, Patternmaster, takes place universe. struggle succession two psionics, young upstart named Teray seemingly unbeatable named Coransee, vying become next “Patternmaster” — is, leader telepathic race known Patternists. Butler sent manuscript Doubleday. then, Cleaver left, Sharon Jarvis, science-fiction editor, accepted submission.
novels poured Butler time. Patternmaster finalized, resurrected Psychogenesis prequel (a newfangled concept jacket copy would describe “pre-sequel”) called Mind Mind. “I write winners — least one,” wrote journal. words, wrote characters aspired become. Patternmaster, two characters upstaged repeatedly Amber, healer neither control. Mind Mind, young, Black psionic named Mary discovers create “pattern,” neural network brings psionics control. first others bristle, soon come discover enjoy mental stability power gives them.
1977, Butler two published novels closer financial security. Jarvis given $1,750 advance Patternmaster, enough live on. editor-writer relationship workmanlike. “What want Sharon Jarvis?” asked herself. hoped least $2,000 advance Mind Mind well “respect, even friendship possible. definitely respect.” two wouldn’t meet published three novels Jarvis, Jarvis surprised learn Butler Black. “I went science-fiction convention introduced opened mouth, stepped back, stared,” Butler said. “Then played knowing behaving way.” (Jarvis recalled this, too. “When editor, didn’t give crap somebody’s background,” said.)
Although Mind Mind accepted publication, Jarvis said catch. time, books part Doubleday’s library-subscription project, earmarked certain number genre titles send public libraries. this, Jarvis said books “clean” expletives would removed publication. “There absolutely problem scenes, necessity rewriting, four-letter words come out,” Jarvis wrote letter. “Even use ‘Christ’ expletive must go.” (The N-word, however, published without concern.)
Butler intentional cuss words, even outlining ones character would use. (The character Karl, instance, would stick religious outbursts like “Hell!”) felt changes made dialogue stilted untrue. wrote back, “I’m sure could convince anybody that, instance, Mary, feisty (usually) angry lower-class Black woman says ‘Oh shoot!’ ‘Forget you!’”
“I don’t think story suffers way change it,” Jarvis responded. “Consider Barry Malzberg’s words: ‘If it’s money versus integrity, money wins every time.’” continued, “If take blatantly offensive words fuck shit leave hells damns, happy. still list Mind Mind second-stringer possible warning attached, couldn’t offer another $1,750.” (Jarvis said maximum amount could offer author time $3,000.) exchange became increasingly tense, ending Jarvis saying could keep expletives, fuck nonnegotiable. “Is finally clear?” wrote.
Butler’s relationship Doubleday continued deteriorate. discovered science-fiction writers hadn’t heard Patternmaster wasn’t listed catalogue sold Doubleday bookstore Los Angeles. review copy Mind Mind hadn’t sent Mike Hodel, radio-show host set interview with. general, little effort promote books beyond library presales. “I can’t help feel though I’m trouble find bring proof booksellers book even exists,” Butler wrote. “Take stride,” Jarvis replied asked issues. “I’ve heard worse.”
Butler didn’t feel options: hoping sell company Survivor, third installment series. didn’t think book ready publication, needed money could travel Maryland research next book. Jarvis would offer $1,750 Survivor, either, time sex scene agreed book “needed.” “What you’ve told mild three-paragraph sex scene going cost $250,” Butler replied. “I can’t pretend happy that. accept offer $1,750, I’m happy.”

Butler would promote herself. sent Patternmaster Ms. Magazine review consideration. regularly attended science-fiction conventions like Westercon network sell books. met fellow Black science-fiction writer, Steven Barnes, one them, would commiserate years lack support work. “How win?” said Barnes. “How play game way doesn’t break hearts send us poorhouse?”
Perhaps Butler’s efforts, books sold better Doubleday expected. Jarvis told Mind Mind went second printing “because underestimated advance sales.” Soon after, Butler received letter young agent Writers House named Felicia Eth asking representation. point, Butler’s experience agent mother paid $61.20 — month’s rent — scammer. (“Ignorance expensive,” Butler would later write.) Writing best seller constant preoccupation — way make life financially sustainable. “I need something sells itself,” wrote. “Something screams significance scariness timeliness loudly can’t ignored.”
next book would first stand-alone novel. Titled Kindred, represented new level maturity Butler writer become one enduring works. blends historical fiction time travel, sending Dana, modern-day writer living Los Angeles, antebellum-era plantation Maryland family roots. time-travel mechanism psychological trap: life one Dana’s ancestors, white slave owner named Rufus, threatened, pulled orbit save him. believes life threatened, returns home. Dana’s existence depends saving Rufus allowing live long enough rape ancestor, free Black woman named Alice. Butler spent weeks Baltimore researching city’s historical society; read deeply, including George Rawick’s first 19 volumes slave narratives, American Slave; autobiographies Frederick Douglass Harriet Jacobs; journals slave owners’ wives “to understand point view, too.”
Early career, Butler received criticism writing explicitly racial politics. “Why write stuff?” recalled asked. “You write something that’s politically relevant struggle.” first got idea Kindred college member Black Student Union. discussion another student — male, age, middle class, self-appointed scholar things Black history — never forgot. “I wish could kill old people holding us back long, can’t would start parents,” remembered saying. believed older generations blame lack racial equity “should rebelled” slavery. impertinence reminded younger. days mother couldn’t find sitter, would bring Butler worked people’s homes. entered back door, white people spoke front didn’t exist. One day, told mother, “I never do. terrible.” Normally, mother would put place, day didn’t say anything. gave daughter quiet look.
“I carried look number years understood it,” Butler said interview 2003. “I didn’t leave school 10, never missed meal, always roof head mother willing demeaning work accept humiliation. wanted teach writing Kindred people mother frightened timid cowards, heroes.”
Initially, tried writing Kindred male protagonist — dissimilar self-righteous friend — found couldn’t keep alive. proud Black man like would look white man dead eye? wouldn’t last long enough learn “the rules submission.” No, reasoned, main character female gender would make seem less threatening. “I wild Kindred,” said Eth. “It real departure people writing reading about.” Eth hoping sell mainstream title, i.e., science fiction, queried numerous publishers: Simon & Schuster, William Morrow, Putnam. editors resisted genre mixing. “The blend realism fantasy didn’t work mind,” replied Daphne Abeel Houghton Mifflin. Gail Winston Random House liked book said “couldn’t get support needed push through.” Butler restless, Eth counseled patience. Kindred “is wonderful book it’s easily categorized, expect that’s going mean work harder faith it,” Eth wrote. “I faith don’t want give up.”
Funnily enough, Kindred ended Doubleday: Eth sold editor fiction department $5,000. book published 1979 received muted response. New York legacy media ignored it, reviewed Essence, Ms. Magazine, science-fiction publications like Locus Asimov’s Science Fiction. “Black writers know Black,” said. “But couple experiences helped that.” One came Veronica Mixon, young Black assistant editor Doubleday, pitched first magazine profile Butler 1979 issue Essence titled “Futurist Woman.” Kindred fell print, book allowed Butler understand readership was: Black community among women. Moreover, began feel owed money commensurate work. “I sold cheap long permit sold cheap,” wrote. “Enough enough. permit again.”
journals, particularly 1970s ’80s, Butler would deliver self-assessments looks, personality, comportment. younger less confident, often reprimanded saying something thought embarrassing. wanted become “unembarrassable” later understood needed let go that. “I maintain distance people fear. Fear pain give see naked. find merely ugly, foolish without value,” wrote. “The defense care.”
middle age, would describe “comfortably asocial,” journals reflect deep yearning intimacy. Loneliness constant affliction. wanted companionship sex. “Another person would help grow socially,” wrote. “A lasting relationship would good me.” Often, imagined man: “We want man six feet tall. White, Black, yellow, care.” Still, relationships men emotionally fulfilling; sex brief “never initiated” her. late 20s, also imagined woman. “I know social stigma, would rather love women,” wrote. “I easily. Closeness men doesn’t seem fulfill except physically.”
Butler 28, decided stop living inside head meet women. worried relationship woman could impact career. “Isn’t Black female stigma enough?” wondered. “It could hurt me. However small am, could. keep low coming out, fear shame?” great hesitation, picked phone call Gay Lesbian Center L.A. inquire upcoming meetups. “Of course it’s possible thing center group teach don’t want part particular group,” wrote. “Not don’t share unifying inclination. oblique today? lesbianism.”
journal first meetup burns intensity detail. “A lot look like police women — odd smugness ‘authority’ them, ‘tough’ little face, slightly pushed together without ugly,” observed attendees. noticed white. watched kiss one another way knew wasn’t “sisterly” felt pangs envy. time spoke correct woman — “white, pretty, one I’d never suspected” — making incorrect claims parapsychology. (Then worried coming killjoy know-it-all.) wondered attractive enough played scenarios head: pursue lifestyle, appearance would mean “the ‘male’ burden would me” courting women.
Butler ended day heap anguish. friend guide her. wasn’t confident women would interested — gay women liked attractive women, straight men did. Many social anxieties tied lack money, thought would make “more civilized, socialized.” another meeting later month, decided done. sat center’s announcements went home. “I don’t belong belong anywhere else,” wrote. “It would require effort I’m willing put forth make part people. They’re me. found woman went well with, could make it.”
far close friends editors knew, Butler wasn’t romantic partnership. “I sorry seem deep, intimate relationship,” said Barnes. “It difficult artists. sense existential loneliness human beings get. price willing pay become human wanted be. became person, takes get everything want everything you’ve got. Life takes everything.”

Butler never learned drive. adult, realized dyslexic (she hadn’t received official diagnosis child) needed time read; didn’t want risk trying read street signs behind wheel. Instead, took bus, inconvenient way getting around L.A. one created constant proximity strangers relied municipal system; became steady source inspiration writing. observed people occasionally wrote character sketches. one bus ride, watched fight break out: One man accused another looking funny (he wasn’t) lunged him. moment, Butler thought opening line next short story, “Speech Sounds”: “There trouble aboard Washington Boulevard bus.”
story set dystopic near future pandemic degrades people’s ability communicate, “Speech Sounds” came depressive period Butler. early ’80s, languishing new novel, Blindsight, felt “thin impoverished” version Mind Mind. (It would go unpublished.) friend Phyllis dying multiple myeloma time, every week, Butler would bring new chapter Clay’s Ark, fifth Patternist book working on, read. Butler’s Uncle Clarence recently died, another friend attempted suicide. house burgled thieves took typewriters, tape recorders, TV, radio — something happened multiple times. worried safety told Barnes wanted take martial-arts classes. “The main thing felt wronged,” wrote one burglary. “As though expected world fair sensible place people see folly well ‘injustice’ robbing poor. thought, it? little.”
Meanwhile, felt world state regression. Butler self-professed news junkie keen interest political leaders going back Nixon-Kennedy debates. wanted understand words held sway people. “Bigotry easing back fashion,” wrote shortly presidential election Ronald Reagan. attack social-welfare programs environmental regulations funny math Reaganomics filled dread. “Reagan tool utterly self-interested, fatally shortsighted men — men deem virtue indifferent human suffering,” wrote. “We probably go solving problems borrowing future forced consequences behavior change.” would filter misgivings next series: Xenogenesis trilogy, sold Warner Books three-book deal 1985. contract — $75,000, divided around submission installment — strongest yet received buoyed part publishers’ renewed interest science fiction. sent mother money bought plane ticket Peru location-scout books.

Science fiction categorized three types stories: “What if?,” “If only,” “If goes on.” first Xenogenesis book, Dawn, born Butler’s horror Reagan administration’s notion “winnable nuclear war” — worst imaginable scenario “If goes on.” protagonist, Lilith, awakened cryogenic sleep alien race called Oankali nuclear holocaust destroyed Earth. Oankali tell Lilith humanity doomed “two incompatible characteristics”: intelligence hierarchical nature. Butler designed Oankali trigger instinctive response fear disgust; they’re covered long tentacles like invertebrates. humans xenophobic, aliens xenophilic. Oankali give Lilith “choice” — either go back cryogenic-like state help awaken humans mate Oankali start new race. Essentially, evolve die. beginning Butler’s “fix world” books, attempts work whether humanity could save itself. Throughout trilogy, returns core observation: intelligence need dominance would lead self-annihilation.

Butler’s dire prognosis world brought acclaim. 1984, Hugo Award Best Short Story “Speech Sounds,” followed another Hugo first Nebula Bloodchild. returned Clarion teacher following year. Beacon Press line feminist science fiction bought rights reissue Kindred 1988, move would seriously expand book’s readership. Christmas, paid mortgage mother’s house.
Butler 40s now. wanted write “magnum opus,” felt lost fuel kept going far. “In way, run dry,” wrote moment discouragement. “You start repeat write research and/or formula. I’m like old prodigy run ‘instinct’ years, must learn craft instinct failed.”
looking ideas, Butler would called “grazing,” practice meant number books open around house perusing whatever might interest her: environmental science, anthropology, microbiology, Black history, political studies. Lately, taken Gaia hypothesis, idea tendered scientists James Lovelock Lynn Margulis Earth like human body, synergistic, self-regulating whole part despite behavior contrary.
graft idea onto space-colonization narratives? Wouldn’t planet reject humans like body rejecting organ transplant? if, instead enacting hostile-native scenario, interstellar colonists afflicted environment tiny bacteria? Humans would learn synergize work planet, rather carry smash-and-grab attitude. could series exploring different worlds peculiar challenges. “I’m researching playing ideas, know way feels I’ve got something good,” wrote 1989 letter agent, Merrilee Heifetz, taken Eth. “I’ve convention week Clarion coming up, can’t quite hide 30 40 books typewriter. That’s feel like doing. see, I’m like I’m love.”
resulting book, Parable Sower, begins Southern California year 2024. Earth, ravaged climate crisis called “the Apocalypse,” “the Pox,” beyond repair. People become chained systems indentured servitude company-owned cities. narrative follows Lauren Olamina, precocious 15-year-old living gated community surrounded adults try fortify defenses. knows safety illusion records beliefs secretly notebook. suffers hyperempathy disorder, crippling condition causes “feel” others feel. forces tougher, faster decision-maker. becomes magnetic leader new religion works slowly subtly actions common sense.
four years, Butler rewrote first 75 pages several times. “Everything wrote seemed like garbage,” said. Poetry finally broke block. “I forced pay attention word word, line line,” said. book, Lauren calls belief system Earthseed — fusion Heraclitus, Darwin, Buddha revolves around core principle “God change.” advocates adaptability communality path survival species. Earthseed verses take form Butler’s motivational writing, transformed self-help contracts poetry. “One first poems wrote sounded like nursery rhyme. begins: God power, goes to: God malleable. concept gave needed,” wrote. ultimate goal Earthseed’s adherents shape Destiny, allow humans “take root among stars.” Space colonization Butler’s equivalent building cathedral. believed extraordinary feat like space travel could bring people together common goal. “Earthseed doesn’t reconcile science fiction religion,” wrote biographer Gerry Canavan. “It remakes science fiction religion.”
Parable Sower published 1993. liked editor time, Dan Simon, listened told various audiences sent book tour. spoke independent Black-owned, science-fiction, feminist bookstores. first time, New York Times reviewed work (albeit part science-fiction roundup). greater culture shifting meet her. “She coming consciousness growth Black publishing,” said writer friend Tananarive Due. “When Black Books movement took 1990s, lot us caught wind.”

year later, mother stroke hospitalized three weeks dying. Butler rarely spoke death publicly friends. “I wrote nothing value time,” said. grief focused well. rut Parable Talents, second series (which recent years would become known featuring fascist president, Andrew Steele Jarret, proclaims “Make America Great Again”). “Later, came back novel, found much less inclined gentle character,” Butler said, referring Lauren. “Also found needed see eyes daughter.” Butler would say “my mother’s last gift me.” mother’s headstone, Butler wrote: “Beloved Mother / Octavia Margaret Butler / 1914–1996 / God Love.”
years mother’s death, Butler bought house Lake Forest Park north Seattle: three-bedroom ranch-style home neatly trimmed hedges front towering cypress trees back. turned one bedrooms library filled wall wall books another study would write.

completion first two Parable books, finally set stage Earthseed believers go stars. ambitious plan four novels title formulation — Trickster, Teacher, Chaos, Clay — set planets. True name, Parable Trickster confounded her. Butler wrote dozens fragments never moved beyond exposition. explored variety ailments planet might afflict new arrivals: blindness hallucinations, body-jumping disease “nearly lethal homesickness.” Nothing working. Republicans continued depress her, particularly George W. Bush’s invasion Iraq Afghanistan. needed break, started writing Fledgling, sexy polyamorous vampire novel, instead.
writing become generally difficult. Beginning late ’90s, Butler began feel fatigued. taking medication high blood pressure heart arrhythmia felt drugs sapping strength sex drive. kept notes symptoms — shortness breath, nausea, back pain, hair loss. condition continued deteriorate new millennium. got pneumonia misdiagnosed left untreated weeks. Soon, couldn’t walk half block without getting tired. “I’m functioning,” wrote 2004. “I sit drowse lot. know I’m thinking well, I’m certainly breathing well.”
February 24, 2006, Butler’s friend Leslie Howle supposed pick bring local conference. Howle Butler met Seattle 1985 Butler teacher Clarion Howle student. Howle remembers then: young mosquito bitten grinning trip Peru. week, Howle became chauffeur, role would continue fill years, particularly Butler moved Seattle. Howle would drive grocery runs Whole Foods Costco, would take hiking expeditions Wallace Creek, Mount Rainier, ice caves. “She really loved getting nature,” said Howle. “If Octavia place saw God, it.”

“What happened Octavia didn’t need happen,” Howle continued. “Despite incredibly powerful person was, assert doctor. Even today, doctors discount women certain age women color. it’s racism, it’s ageism, it’s sexism — ‘isms’ conspired end feel. needed people protective her.”
Shortly Butler’s death, Howle organized memorial service Science Fiction Fantasy Hall Fame Seattle. short notice, 200 people gathered, including friends writers Vonda McIntyre, Nisi Shawl, Harlan Ellison, via video. Howle remembered way Butler would end calls saying, “I’ll seeing you, then.” Butler’s cousin Ernestine Walker said, “There African proverb: ‘As long speak name, live.’”
