2009, comedian Nathan Fielder first moved L.A., learned tell managers send meetings. bother? point charm people giving job, sitting could hurt chances. “I’d always say, ‘If people like stuff I’m making, I’m going anything heighten person,’ ” recalled. “I’m going funny room.”
necessarily case false modesty. Fielder initially strike friends colleagues engaging personality. Tim Heidecker, met 2010, bewildered heard Fielder pitching show, Nathan You, Comedy Central. “Who? guy?” comedian remembered thinking. “He’s deceptive,” said Jimmy Kimmel, Fielder show several times. “Because look go, Oh, seems like normal guy. Maybe even boring normal guy. Maybe even guy I’d bummed sit next plane.”
Nathan You, Fielder used façade bland charmlessness get people say astonishing things. cult hit, ran Comedy Central 2013 2017, kind parody business-improvement shows like Kitchen Nightmares. typical segment, Fielder would visit real small business, usually somewhere Greater Los Angeles area, pitch owner absurd idea — poo-flavored frozen yogurt, special soundproof box vacationing parents could confine children sex hotel room. manner, unusual combination gentle pushy, arrogant insecure, suggested desperate desire liked pathological inability understand wasn’t. asked intrusive questions, stood close people, leaned even closer tried pull away. made show outrageously funny, arguably kind mean, relentless commitment role. Even subjects squirmed discomfort, delivered pitches conviction people nearly always agreed try whatever scheme proposed, matter ridiculous made look.
show positioned Fielder, 39, forefront New York Times recently hailed “quiet revolution” comedy. Along Sacha Baron Cohen John Wilson, collaborated him, belongs contingent comedians specialize exposing sorts behavioral quirks, unsightly warts self, forever trying hide. age fake news filtered pics Big Lies, genre — call “reality comedy” — become improbable source precious truth. Unlike, say, Baron Cohen, scourge NRA shills Rudy Giuliani, Fielder isn’t especially interested politics. distinguishes him, along diabolical intricacy pranks, depth interest human psyche. “I occasionally able draw things interviewee wouldn’t normally reveal television show, he’s able draw more,” said Baron Cohen, one pioneers form. “He took genre stumbled moved forward.” He’s move even further. Rehearsal, HBO, marks Fielder’s return acting directing first time five years, ambitious, thrilling, personal work yet.

Nathan set L.A. devoid Hollywood glamour Silver Lake chic, world electronics chains mall Santas business-casual khakis. Fielder lives Silver Lake, seems belong world, too. met door, dressed nondescript outfit black chinos, white T-shirt, gray New Balances. living room, beige couch, fluffy white pillows — kind neutral décor might find perfectly nice Airbnb. multiple streams internet discourse devoted identifying source inexplicable attractiveness. Perhaps it’s inexplicable. world, witty, self-deprecating, successful. slim build, still-boyish face, thick, slightly unruly salt-and-pepper hair grad student spent month lab pulling consecutive all-nighters. Fielder speaks flat, stilted voice uses show, person, it’s infused tone perpetual, bone-dry amusement. Heidecker, eventually came appreciate subtle charms, described consummate straight man. “He’s really fun person idiot around,” said. “I might say, ‘We start eating dog food,’ he’d like, ‘Why would that?’ ”
house, Fielder introduced cats, Jackie Rocket, trailed us kitchen jumped onto table. “When got them, kittens,” said. “There like ten brothers sisters grouped together, cuddling, one side.” Jackie outcast. “I like, want her,” Fielder said. “She maybe behavioral issues,” added uncertainly. cat, course, creature doesn’t cooperate anyone’s agenda own. Fielder way. chance ask first question, asked several: get reporter’s notebook Amazon? Wasn’t shame opened take notes, interview subjects couldn’t see word NEWS printed large block letters cover? sat kitchen table, finally asked doing. “Well, hate talking myself,” said. claimed something lifelong struggle articulate thoughts. elementary school, speech therapist told knew fewer 500 words, bothered much mother gave book advanced words like abreast. (“Not ‘a breast,’ ” clarified.) “I still, day, feel like don’t know lot words. Maybe it’s that.” shook head. “I don’t know.”
hopped table began pacing around kitchen island, searching pair claw clippers. “Did claw you?” asked, looking Rocket, planted top recorder clawed me. saw writing something notebook. “Are writing ‘Cat clawing Nathan’?” laughed. “ ‘Cat like Nathan,’ ” continued. “ ‘Nathan’s cat like him.’ ” left house, asked would ever abandon story assigned. “What would make bail?”
Rehearsal, like Fielder’s work, quite seems first. show’s sparse marketing materials describe series “the lengths one man go reduce uncertainties everyday life.” opening scene episode one, Fielder walks apartment middle-aged teacher responded vague Craigslist ad. video submission, teacher confessed Fielder spent years agonizing lie told friend trivia team educational background. Fielder greets isn’t exactly like one seen before. warmer, inclined smile. voice-over, notes he’s told personality make people uncomfortable, tries jokes. notices lot doors apartment. “Door city here!” exclaims shy grin. teacher laughs awkwardly.
Fielder come apartment offer may sound like extraordinary gift. Enlisting construction crew small army actors, Fielder build set direct series rehearsals allow teacher practice confessing secret friend, over. if, show asks, could know happen lives happens, could prepare every way might unfold? could take control futures? something poignant, kind wonderful, Fielder appears proposing, anyone who’s watched Nathan knows objective never straightforward. “There’s real Milgram quality Nathan,” said actor comedian H. Jon Benjamin, referring Stanley Milgram, eccentric visionary psychologist known notorious study obedience, begun 1961, lured subjects administering believed electric shocks participants. “It always seemed like another planet learning human customs,” Benjamin told me, “or AI collecting information human behavior.”

cluttered office rental house Echo Park, Fielder flipped open laptop zoomed writers’ room John Wilson, HBO show serves executive producer. Fielder met Wilson chance January 2018 restaurant New York group mutual friends. recently wrapped final season Nathan trying figure next. Fielder says Comedy Central wanted seasons show, ready move on. happened see one Wilson’s documentary shorts experience plaintiff court TV show, appeared deliberately filing bogus lawsuit. night dinner, Fielder suggested make show together. “He wanted pour energy something,” Wilson told me. “And completely changed life.”
Fielder like Milgram, designing experiments study people behave, Wilson anthropologist, obsessively observing humans natural environments. strolls around New York camera, recording interviews New Yorkers surreptitiously documenting strange customs (a woman placing pigeon shopping bag, man dragging air conditioner street leash). episodes take inspiration basic genre internet content: instructional video. tackles different topic: make risotto, throw batteries, make small talk. Wilson actually interested teaching anyone make risotto. He’s interested exploring struggles making risotto — discarding batteries chatting people parties confounding aspects existence seem make life John Wilson perilous adventure. Fielder’s role writers’ room broaden scope investigations, lead Wilson alleys inquiry might otherwise thought pursue.
Today, trying hammer together provisional script episode show’s third season. topic filled Wilson’s heart trepidation. “Is anything new,” Fielder asked, “on public-bathroom front?” Wilson two writers room — Michael Koman, EP co-creator Nathan You, Allie Viti, associate producer — stared back him. already spent days talking hard find use public toilet, analyzing problem every angle, still struggling answer basic question: mundane fixture modern life make people anxious? “It’s relative sound people make,” Fielder proposed. “If people farting lot, you’ll never feel self-conscious.”
Koman disagreed: “I think takes pair shoes completely seize up.”
Wilson, peering thick glasses, nodded. “I feel like people might wear different shoes bathroom look under, don’t know it’s them.”
Fielder clasped hands together professorially. “Obviously, it’s terrifying make noise bathroom people,” conceded. “One strategy, make sound bum, spread cheeks wider avoid fart noise.”
Fielder’s prompting, considered amazing variety public toilets throughout city. Koman reflected comfort “dignity” felt upon taking dump Japan, toilet seats sometimes heated, got Fielder thinking whether people who, living, don’t care bathroom clean comfortable. Fielder proposed sending Wilson morgue interview employees “bathroom politics” place. even people comfortable corpses feel anxious using public toilets, would “ ‘no hope’ moment” rest us, Fielder said.
challenge would getting people respond honestly. Fielder understands people go reality TV, certain expectations they’re supposed act. shows, uses variety tactics throw subjects off-balance — needling misdirecting them, sitting excruciating silence crack. one episode Nathan You, Realtor reveals choked ghost Switzerland; another, gas-station owner nonchalantly says drinks grandson’s pee he’s scared. Fielder sees it, uncomfortable situations prompt people expose parts usually try conceal — qualities make unique often endearing. Zoom, suggested Wilson interview workers without telling episode bathrooms. subjects knew topic toilets, would surely clam or, worse, try funny.
Much Take?
growing subgenre reality comedy, comedians play reactions real people. shows cause mild discomfort; extreme make want curl die.
Fielder 13, friend whose father grandfather magicians. One day, friend showed simple card trick. Fielder begged teach it. friend joined Vancouver Magic Circle, kids sea old men. got job magic store mall, carried deck cards around times, started performing children’s birthday parties. One night dinner, agreed show feat deception short-circuited brain years ago. “It’s impressive,” warned, slipping worn business card wallet. “See card?” flick wrist, card disappeared. asked again. Fielder smiled. “No, I’m going again.”
table illuminated ambient glow enormous sign affixed IT’SUGAR across street. Japanese restaurant outdoor mall Universal Studios theme park, sprawling monument crass consumerism, seductive storytelling, allure animatronic dinosaurs. asked Fielder drew magic kid. hesitation answer sort question come surprise. Fielder’s colleagues described genius edit room, master pulling narratives countless hours incoherent footage, he’s less confident comes telling story. already heard following speech several times slight variations: “I think build story retroactively say, ‘Well, probably this.’ You’re looking logical connections. It’s nice tell story way, don’t know that’s always what’s happening.” fiddled chopsticks, rolling fingers. “I don’t know. Maybe.”
Fielder grew Vancouver, child two social workers, civil servants helped people injured job. family cable, handful VHS tapes grandfather recorded, including Peter Pan musical still aired public television ’80s. Halloween, Fielder’s parents would take away candy replace healthier snacks. sent Jewish elementary school remembers mostly emphasis Holocaust education. “They showing us dead bodies young age,” said. 13, transferred large public school, bewildering experience. “I didn’t understand people made friends,” said. Performing magic, soon discovered, easier conjuring small talk. “You’re saying, ‘Here’s we’re going engage about.’ trick done, interaction ends,” said laugh. Around time, joined high-school improv team. One partners, happened Seth Rogen, recalled Nathan always thing warmup exercises. “It even table would act like burning lava,” said.
studying business University Victoria, Fielder got job, briefly, brokerage, found depressing. decided give year see could succeed comedian, 2005 moved Toronto Humber College’s comedy program joined collective called Laugh Sabbath. bought video camera made hundreds experimental shorts. Katie Crown, frequent collaborator, recalled Fielder particular idea fun. Sometimes would dare something absurd, like draw goatee face chocolate sauce, turn waiter pretend everything normal. presented videos Laugh Sabbath weekly show, noticed people often laughed aspects work hadn’t intended funny — voice, facial expressions. felt freeing. “There transition went trying hide embarrassing parts appreciating things hated before,” said.
Fielder’s videos caught eye producer Hour 22 Minutes, Canada’s equivalent Daily Show. 2007, developed interview segment show called “Nathan Side.” went around country shirt tie confronting real people questions local correspondent would ever ask. one, sits professional matchmaker inquires “get kiss.” hypothetical question, really expect kiss him? essential elements Nathan persona already place — inscrutable affect, disturbing man-child’s gaze, talent responding awkward moment making ten times worse. “Whenever people feeling like they’re ready,” matchmaker replies, looking little concerned headed. “Okay,” presses on. “Are feeling like you’re ready?” tries break tension joke. “Sure,” says, laughing, “We won’t tell husband.” “Okay,” replies. camera lingers panicked expression laughter slowly grows brittle dies. end segment, holding face inches hers.
Fielder mid-20s, Koman, working head writer Comedy Central sketch show Important Things Demetri Martin, hired writer. One colleagues show, H. Jon Benjamin, found endearing, odd. “We’d go eat, everyone would order, waiter would come would stall,” recalled. “He would ask every dish. would ask ingredients were. remember asking chicken teriyaki for, like, three minutes — ‘What’s it? What’s sauce? like it?’ — point server like, ‘I don’t time this.’ assumption, think, joke, entertaining thing watch. joking — could order. like he’d spent six years alone room magic wandering around like foreigner world.” Benjamin offered Fielder job acting writing Comedy Central series Jon Benjamin Van. Fielder’s tenure show, Koman pitched Nathan Comedy Central. Benjamin first watched it, struck much Fielder saw work. “He kind exposing obsessive personality disorder,” said.

2011, ideal time Fielder sell show strange Nathan television network. Jackass Baron Cohen proved America appetite absurdist stunts, Office revealed desire scenes excruciating awkwardness set drab confines suburban business environment. Fielder’s interests always obscure. One artists admires British mentalist illusionist Derren Brown. one Brown’s television specials, Fielder suggested watch, Brown brainwashes businesspeople never trouble law committing believe genuine armed robbery. “He’s guy made something can’t figure it’s done it’s good,” Koman said. “If guess drove Nathan, would feel like made something qualities.”
best moments, Nathan didn’t make laugh. provoked feelings awe, affection, and, infrequently, desire vortex open center couch swallow whole. 2015 season-three finale, deviates show’s business theme, Fielder sets help Corey, “hopeless” man dead-end job, get girlfriend become “national hero.” typical reality show, would involved fitness program, makeover, session two lifestyle guru. Fielder, instead, yanks back curtain American obsession personal transformation, belief quick fix, overnight success, stretches back Dale Carnegie beyond, revealing emptiness core.
episode took six months make. Fielder begins quest hiring fourth-generation circus performer teach walk wire. disposes Corey, hiding two weeks trailer Mojave Desert. ostensible protagonist safely way, Fielder puts padded bodysuit prosthetic mask Corey’s face becomes him. meets woman named Jasmine posing Corey online, goes date her, spends whole night dancing. “It nice, once, night away insecurities,” drones voice-over.
reality, performance grueling test stamina. Eric Notarnicola, writer editor show, recalled Fielder sitting makeup chair four hours day two weeks technicians painstakingly affixed Corey prosthetic face. “It would look like crying, sweat pouring holes eyes mask,” Notarnicola said. “He’d torture get good scene.”
climax episode one troubling, profound, funny sequences four seasons. Wearing Corey’s face, Fielder walks back forth across wire strung two seven-story office buildings crowd spectators, reporters, Corey’s grandparents cheer on. last, hidden crowd tent roof, switches places Corey, instructing walk waiting arms Jasmine, woman never met. Corey tells Fielder he’s confused what’s happening, leaves tent hears roar crowd sees girl beaming him, meets moment. Following Fielder’s directions, asks wants kiss. consents, call given false information she’s fed. Corey looks crowd news cameras delivers speech Fielder wrote him, glowing unearned pride. Corey’s response Fielder’s scheme, crowd’s response Corey, captures much Nathan reveals human nature — willingness we’re told matter wrong seems, credulous belief heroes tidy narratives. episode winds down, camera dwells close-up lonely magician, sad clown behind all. Makeup artists peel away prosthetic face, revealing Fielder’s dead eyes, empty expression, like something horror movie death American Dream.
Fielder said mother thinks ethnomethodology, obscure discipline sociocultural analysis. Ethnomethodologists attempt examine society study ordinary people everyday affairs, part designing experiments aimed disrupting rules govern human behavior. one classic experiment, discipline’s founder, Harold Garfinkel, instructed students pretend lodgers homes without revealing parents siblings doing. “For part, family members amused,” Garfinkel later noted 1967 book Studies Ethnomethodology, defining text field. Even students explained assignments, unwilling subjects felt manipulated used. “Please, experiments,” sister one student begged. “We’re rats, know.”
Nathan first aired, many critics hailed brilliant, wondered wasn’t also cruel. Slate culture podcast 2014, Dan Kois said moments “the concepts really hit” times made “deeply unhappy” “and world.” Watching show, sometimes hard worry people it. know getting into?
answer usually, least first. Fielder’s producers would typically tell business owners making show small businesses MTV Networks (Comedy Central’s parent company). Fielder tended appear contracts signed cameras rolling. realized joke early happy play along. Joy Lazarus, owner ranch offered horseback rides, didn’t mind Fielder’s tendency ask many unusual questions. “He really intrigued horses,” said fondly. widow late Judge Filosa, recurring character, said Fielder crew showed funeral. “That show best thing could happened him,” said. “He loved it.”
Others upset experience. season three, Eric Belland working manager outdoor-clothing store Fielder set display windbreaker he’d designed raise awareness Holocaust. Belland offended display — “bodies ovens service humor” — felt Fielder cast “rube.” didn’t feel better saw episode realized joke. “He looks like idiot within confines show,” said, “but looks like nasty trickster outside confines show supposed be.” Mark Rappaport, inventor toy called Doinkit, said knew Fielder bit couple minutes disliked anyway. “He trying get say things would harmful business,” said, “and show funny was.”
hard tell watching show given subject feel it. fans debate cringiest moments Reddit, sometimes cite scene actress named Victoria Lynn. episode, Fielder stages play bar highly impractical attempt circumvent California’s ban indoor smoking. Lynn cast one roles. one point, Fielder proposes acting exercise. gazes eyes instructs say “I love you.” One running jokes series Fielder desperate connect someone, anyone, use power television host wheedle affirmation everyone meets. “I’m believing point,” Fielder says episode. “Say again.” does. “Again,” says. happens 11 times, ending Lynn points Fielder tears eyes. Viewers wondered whether felt harassed threatened, turns out, great experience. “He seemed like needed hear ‘I love you,’ ” told me, “and felt really comfortable giving that.”
Fans often said Nathan exposes cruelty capitalism, depicting America place people nearly anything survive. also large part make show unsettling watch. focusing small businesses, depends participation people struggling, many immigrants people color. one unpleasant segments, Fielder pitches owner Help Cleaning Service idea says would allow offer “the fastest clean country.” suggestion, owner dispatches 40 employees small apartment. Crammed place like clowns clown car, manage clean eight minutes. finish, Fielder lines front man lives there, middle-aged white guy, tells he’s single. guy compliments women hard work, Fielder turns jokes, “If you’re lucky, could hard work you.” women look unamused.
owner housecleaning service, Kandiie Tapia, Mexican immigrant. 22 Fielder’s producers told wanted interview built business. felt honored someone wanted share story called family tell good news. producers rushed process signing contract, “flipped switch,” said. taping, found Fielder rude. character, didn’t know that, technique sometimes involved getting rise subject. one point, Tapia said, blew nose tissue asked would throw him. “You’re Help, right?” recalled asking her. (No exchange made episode.) “It power move,” told me. “Like he’s white I’m minority I’m young.” talked husband dropping out, still thought show could benefit business. episode aired Tapia realized comedy, embarrassed told family watch it. “If I’d known really was, would said no,” said. “I’m gonna go show voluntarily made fun of.”
Fielder said surprised upset learn Tapia felt. “It kills time hear people didn’t like experience,” said. “I remember excited it.” didn’t recall asking throw tissue calling “the Help” couldn’t imagine done that. “I don’t want invalidate anyone’s experience,” said, “but know types jokes might make.” pointed one meant look like fool episode. “I definitely feel I’m pathetic person everything do.”
Still, wondered core idea Nathan might explain Tapia would feel upset would never know. One show’s central jokes business owners think ideas dumb anyway. “Sometimes want promotion they’re making calculation,” said. “Sometimes don’t want hurt feelings tell I’m excited it. sometimes might play power dynamic presence cameras pressure moment making say ‘yes.’ ” cameras aren’t rolling, Fielder said, team regularly check make sure people want keep going. goal “was give ordinary people experience outside day-to-day lives. generally people assumption reality TV fairly absurd thing.” said one subject ever quit. maybe people hadn’t dropped dynamic show critiques. “You checking someone they’re constantly saying, ‘Yes, great, let’s it.’ might completely true, later might change mind. It’s weird paradox,” said. “The thing we’re satirizing power dynamics also challenge making show. get wrong.”

Universal Studios, Fielder suggested take culture: live stunt show based Waterworld, 1995 postapocalyptic epic starring Kevin Costner. movie flop historic proportions, yet show, improbably, still going strong. Wednesday afternoon, stadium packed crowd shrieking. “What percentage people even know Waterworld movie?” Fielder wondered.
Life, Fielder acutely aware, unpredictable. Rehearsal grew exhaustive efforts anticipate episode Nathan would unfold. prepare every scene, Fielder team tried imagine reasonable person might react unreasonable suggestions, role-playing ways exchange might go down. Even so, people would invariably say things Fielder failed see coming. Nathan ended, struck would interesting make show futility trying predict future. “It’s sort universal people want control lives,” said. “There’s something really funny compulsion.”
waited show begin, performer hyped crowd, blasting hose directly guy front row. “We zero control water goes!” shouted. Fielder gestured toward green line feet front us, outer boundary splash zone. “It’s kind good little risk getting splashed,” said. faintest suggestion wistfulness, added sitting splash zone “would be, guess, thrilling experience.” action began, sat still, watching closely, hands tucked beneath legs. Plumes smoke billowed seaplane, stuntman dove 45-foot-high platform engulfed flames. “Do think dye water blue make look like water?” Fielder asked. “Looks little blue.”
Like Waterworld show, Rehearsal involved construction artificial reality. help teacher pilot episode prepare difficult conversation friend, Fielder’s team built exact replica Alligator Lounge, bar Brooklyn two friends planned meet, rips stool cushions. “It expensive pilot,” Fielder said. “One crew members told cost replicate bar probably cost build real bar.” show’s main story line features woman doesn’t know whether wants kids. simulate experience raising child birth 18 years old, Fielder moves house countryside hires dozens child actors play son. outset, it’s clear insane idea, Fielder woman intent pretending otherwise, murky reasons. Despite effort gone creating simulacrum domestic life, something off, glitches become obvious time. one scene, woman dutifully pulls store-bought vegetables dirt behind house, acting picking real garden. Later, kitchen, washes eggplants, Fielder spots sticker pepper counter, carefully flips pepper over, concealing flaw. Nathan showed easily could deceived, Rehearsal explores eagerness deceive ourselves. “I often feel envious others,” Fielder says voice-over. “The way believe.”
series progresses, line Fielder’s life work blurs, finds center experiment. times, seems question wisdom manipulating people way does. teacher likens Willy Wonka, looks disturbed. “Isn’t bad guy?” asks. credits roll, hear eerie tinkling celesta, swell strings, Gene Wilder’s voice, soft cotton candy. engineer moment intimacy teacher, takes heated pool. Hoping get guy open up, says married. teacher begins talking pain divorce, moment later, conversation ends. “I didn’t want go deep private life,” Fielder explains voice-over, “so preplanned elderly swimmer interrupt us.” Fielder appears scenes unlike real Fielder. “You’re seeing control wanting share,” told me. “I’m aware I’m like that, it’s show.”
lunch day Waterworld show, reluctant say much Rehearsal. “I don’t want extra context,” said. “The thing thing.” asked anything going personal life contributed desire make it, said wasn’t sure. “You could try make story connect yourself, … don’t know. It’s hard know ideas come feel something certain time.” pause, added, “I go divorce.” looked table, folding paper plate stuffing little plastic cup.

Fielder gotten married 2011 children’s librarian met friend’s comedy show Halifax. Three years later, midst making second season Nathan You, marriage fell apart. Everything suddenly felt uncertain. “I like, Wow, I’m bad life,” said. wondered whether could done something, anything, differently. One day, broke middle big meeting. Losing control emotions, said, “a jarring experience.”
