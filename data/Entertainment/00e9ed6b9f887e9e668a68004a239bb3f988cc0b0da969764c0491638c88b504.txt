Prepare angst angry stomp outs lots “I hate yous” she’s baaaaaaack. Woodstone’s resident ’80s teen ghost Stephanie awoken attic slumber (remember, teenage ghosts hibernate year) looking wreak havoc Woodstone mansion. Teenagers objectively scarier ghosts, teenage ghost? Terrifying. one safe.
time around, Jay accidentally wakes Stephanie trying hide fancy sneakers bought NYC weekend, purchase he’s trying keep secret Sam, instead telling spent entire time playing Dungeons & Dragons time life. mean, part mostly true sad, omits sneakers thing. It’s little secret Stephanie uses advantage takes upon destroy every single couple Woodstone one one. You’ll remember Stephanie whopper crush Trevor, since she’s eternally teenager grown man, wants nothing her. doesn’t matter that, reminds him, she’s technically 54 years old; never happening. Plus, informs her, he’s taken man days.
that’s beginning end: Stephanie hears Trevor Hetty, people, paired off, Thor Flower Isaac Nigel too, Stephanie livid alone. Sam tries comfort quote Sixteen Candles, Stephanie’s favorite movie, Jay tries comfort hopeful thought one day maybe teenage boy get gruesome car accident property Stephanie find love him. Jay nothing romantic, know? doesn’t matter; Stephanie warpath destroy every couple can.
Stephanie shows Sam sneakers hidden attic. Sam starts asking Jay weekend, unexpected truth emerges: Jay job interview head chef position old restaurant city. misses lot old life — especially, know, able talk hear people around him. He’s unhappy, he’s unhappy, little bit. do? Sam can’t live New York, it’s horror show, also doesn’t want Jay constantly wish somewhere else. isn’t tiff expensive sneakers; major issue Jay Sam deal with.
end, though, Stephanie’s plan backfires. Sam learns sneakers — well, half sneakers — belong Mark, contractor, Mark reminds Sam there’s barn property needs lot work good bones, Sam idea: thinks Jay convert barn destination restaurant. Jay loves idea, loves wife, loves Mark going business partner venture. probably loves last thing most. offense Sam, Jay really needs friends.
Stephanie’s attempts becoming Destroyer Love Woodstone success rate. reminds Thor Flower nothing common, honestly old news, two eventually realize “knowledge owls” that’s … nothing, apparently? two concept owls fine. Stephanie also plants seed Trevor’s head Hetty loving loud, he’ll stuck boring boyfriend stuff. isn’t necessarily wrong: Trevor gets trapped painfully boring double date Isaac Nigel topic, hours, simply tea. thing Trevor offer conversation love Snapple, reference land. Trevor Hetty agree things much better much hotter sneaking around hooking up. Hetty didn’t worry boyfriend whose “knowledge steam engines [is] rudimentary best.” end, stage public fight make look like they’ve ended things, it’s trick: meet back “the shadows” pick things left them. It’s win-win. Trevor Hetty win get actually enjoy one another again, win get hear Hetty say, “Now take me, bare-assed libertine.” show, friends? show?
you’re keeping count, that’s three strikes Stephanie. doesn’t even attempt take Isaac Nigel. Perhaps moved Isaac’s retelling got together: “It’s sort adorable story: He’s British, killed him.” Stephanie pretty wrecked fact died teenager, she’s relegated spending eternity alone since teens property. It’s Nancy, cholera ghost, saves day: Hasn’t Stephanie met Ralph before? one’s met Ralph before! Ralph teen cholera ghost who’s hanging basement whole time. Could true love? Well, one major roadblock: Ralph wearing glasses looks like total dork. wait! “If Here” Thompson Twins, famously Sixteen Candles, starts playing, Ralph slowly removes glasses, Stephanie never gazed upon someone hot. “You look like those?” asks amazement. head attic awkward small talk (“So kind music like?” “I heard music three times life.”) Samantha Baker/Jake Ryan kiss moment. like that, Stephanie’s reign terror winds giving Woodstone couples happy ending. sojourn attic bring next year?
