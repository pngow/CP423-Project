Comedy Bang! Bang! Podcast: Book: Interview
I’ve heard humanity’s podcast, humanity’s book? 14 years hundos episodes, Comedy Bang! Bang! exists book form Comedy Bang! Bang! Podcast: Book. Somehow, host Scott Aukerman managed take show’s freewheeling “open-door policy” spontaneous, silly character interactions channel print. Contributors like Andy Daly, Jon Gabrus, Carl Tart, Tim Baltz, Paul F. Tompkins, Ego Nwodim, Lauren Lapkus, Shaun Diston, Drew Tarver prove characters funny paper ear canals new material. Heck, Aukerman even got famous fans like Lin-Manuel Miranda Jeffrey Characterwheaties involved. comedian recently chatted collaborators pulled massive group project explained podcast might never end.
book full things like fake advertisements board games. come high-concept sections? started envisioning book, knew wanted like sketch show. want whole bunch different tones looks. I’d reach collaborators, would figure popular characters, would pitch idea. either would go write themselves, would collaboration me. right wire, literally last day.
try strike balance older classic characters new ones? There’s long lead time book, made publisher promise could get pieces last minute. point, Dr. Sweetchat (Gil Ozeri) year couple months old. Minksalmon Brothers officially year old. still people would liked involved didn’t make cutoff nine months ago, officially close everything down. People like Lisa Gilroy. there’s ever second book, would great get people like involved.
talk working Harris Wittels’s sister brother-in-law “Harris’s Foam Corner” section? Harris integral part show. knew wanted something him, couldn’t figure “Farts Procreation” thing book, since he’s longer us. Then, thinking “Foam Corner,” big part jotting ideas Notes app phone. knew Stephanie Wittels Wachs phone didn’t really want go it. kind gingerly made request, husband go it, didn’t really feel like it, understandably.
one day, got email ton JPEGs Notes app stuff. really special. took upon go clean up. stand-up ephemeral, never recorded special, really wanted make definitive place could go joke writing. left stuff idea talking about. think that’s one typos book is, think would find funny: word “titties” misspelled “kitties.” [Laughs.]
acknowledgments, sweet tribute daughter. like getting book print becoming father? basically wrote acknowledgments Riverside waiting born. I’m glad able get there, strange. I’m sure odd her, older father. She’ll heard things decades prior born. physical artifact look go, don’t understand it, know something.
Ego Nwodim weirder character comedy Saturday Night Live, feels like CBB’s sensibility breaking wider world. see podcast’s influence point comedy large? podcast dependent upon people like Ego coming brilliance. feel like I’m deliverer people’s sensibilities creator sensibility. it’s great Ego gets weird stuff SNL, that’s point view, she’s funny. less barriers weird Comedy Bang! Bang! mainstream media. think people grew listening show became comedians artists, maybe it’s effect point view.
Lately I’ve surprised people telling children listening it. I’ve couple people tell last couple days, like, “My 14-year-old loves show listens time.” get — 13, 14, loved Monty Python Hitchhiker’s Guide Galaxy. I’m always kind shocked anything I’m would interest young people. it’s great.
Part aren’t many spaces character comedy like CBB. Character bits don’t topical humor satire reference-based, necessarily. think funny voices general really appealing kids. That’s started interested comedy. grew era SNL broad characters, like Billy Crystal Fernando. could work Fernando impression, kind like, Oh, wow, I’m sort funny I’m impression person who’s actually funny!
spirit funny moment really think people take away Comedy Bang! Bang! hope it’s inspiring people, much entertainment days pre-scripted. One last times network talk show, three pre-interviews producers, right went on, went exactly order going talk about. Hearing people joyful moment making laugh surprising something wish media. I’m glad podcasts, otherwise would none it.
launched new podcasting hub, CBB World, 2021, CBB newer podcasts. think paid-subscription model industry heading? CBB World trying stay ahead trends anything like that. It’s truly trying empower artists want do. Podcasting got little bit restrictive way, bar high order make money terms much listenership have. People either free podcast lot people could listen to, get even people listen order make money. behind paywalls one would listen it, would get paid it.
felt like could really split difference. CBB established listenership that’s pretty large pay subscription service, people best worlds. lot people listen show, I’ll pay well. started math it, started realizing could work. It’s fun let people whatever want without someone hovering shoulder. Podcasting, me, freedom, they’re expensive make. get people, get paid it? That’s we’re trying do.
acknowledgments book, little parenthetical say, “Here’s another fourteen years! (Okay, maybe three.)” mean it? Three years short. Three sounds short you? try something … long worked Vulture?
There’s much culture that’s stayed consistently good, year year, minute minute. Thank you. 60 Minutes, good 40. 20 garbage.
We’ve always ups downs. first year ever TV show, didn’t plan time well, podcast days, people thought sounded tired. ten years ago now. New people discover it, old people dip out, never know it’s received. feel like past years, it’s really good quality level. I’m probably hardest that. worry suddenly getting big slump. I’m worried overstaying welcome.
kind think, Well, ever end? I’ve done things past I’ve stopped fun still extra year. we’re fun, there’s reason get stage round number, like 20 years 1,000 episodes you. I’m envisioning right now. I’m worried about, like, dying one day, last episode put shitty one. I’d prefer die nice, good anniversary episode something, would last one people hear. whole “three years” thing kind joke, point, don’t see reason stop.
fans long haul. hope they’re invested. long, overarching stories lot characters, don’t think they’re ever going resolve like Succession will. wonder end could possibly be. hope people stick out, understand people start different priorities life listening people silly.
Would ever Comedy Bang! Bang! musical? Look, I’ll honest: I’m talking someone musical right now, it’s lot work. thing I’m conceptualizing right now, wouldn’t Comedy Bang! Bang! thing. passion Samantha [Weiner, book’s editor] book really inspired me, fact it’s selling well many fans buying gratifying, that’s motivates me, honestly.
people ask, “Why don’t Comedy Bang! Bang! movie based TV show?” I’m like, “Well, one watched TV show.” People watching something makes want something, know mean? feel like there’s audience that’s going receptive. So, musical, don’t think enough people interested enough justify working one.
always believe something’s going popular thing world, even it’s not, that’s drives me. I’m driven money fame, mainly I’m famous, I’m really driven people enjoying something. Like excited get like Gil Ozeri sends Sparkalonius musical, know it’s scheduled come week, can’t wait people hear it. That’s motivates work anything. That’s book was.
