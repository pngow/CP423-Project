New York, New York Barely Scratches Surface New York, New York
count, actors New York, New York say sing words New York 16 times get title song — which, start spreading news, show’s grand finale — though feels like hundreds. Nearly every exchange David Thompson Sharon Washington’s book involves discussion city. hear “New York City greatest social experiment,” “everybody New York something can’t someplace else,” “New York major chord.” Plus there’s lot ragging areas America, including Philly (“a minor chord”); Memphis; Cleveland; Los Angeles; Natchez, Mississippi; Texas; and, course, New Jersey. show which, might say Hours Home Alone 2, city another character drama. city pretty much character, forcing everyone else supporting roles. New York see onstage thoroughly overvenerated barely resembles real place. (Baudrillard would wild time theater one.) Watching actors spout aphorisms — one experiences “New York luck,” concept I’m familiar — started wonder actually live place did. glorious Xanadu? related Eric Adams’s emoji-based tourism campaign?
Nominally, New York, New York love story involving boy, girl, big city. musical very, loosely inspired 1977 Martin Scorsese film New York, New York, starring Robert De Niro Liza Minnelli saxophonist singer involved tumultuous love affair. film also origin “New York, New York” song — officially titled “Theme New York, New York” — written De Niro’s character Minnelli’s. John Kander Fred Ebb (then, Cabaret Chicago) wrote 45-minute snit De Niro demanded better initially come with. Soon, via Minnelli Frank Sinatra, went become staple New York sports home games. musical retains standard well “But World Goes ’Round,” keeps names, post–World War II setting, rough configuration main characters, quickly turns thing. it’s Colton Ryan’s Jimmy Doyle wooing Anna Uzele’s Francine Evans, among group characters chasing dreams, including Black trumpeter Mississippi (John Clay III), Polish violinist (Oliver Prose), Cuban drummer (Angel Sigala). musical contains grab bag trunk songs Kander Ebb, new songs worked together Ebb’s death 2004, new work Kander working solo, new songs lyrics eternal New York cheerleader Lin-Manuel Miranda (picking Hamilton’s Schuyler sisters, praising “the greatest city world,” left off).

level talent involved, could go wrong? frustratingly large amount. crucial flaw Jimmy Francine’s story line, theoretically would bind show together underwritten underperformed. Jimmy, we’re told, inveterate talker drinker, charming despite impulsive tendencies, he’s never believably grim place long. Ryan, Jimmy, also boyish squeaky clean taken seriously, reminding high-schooler trying play Sky Masterson. Uzele’s Francine flirt well — there’s fun number shows ability play orchestra’s worth musical instruments — dynamic never escalates becomes romantic erotic. Uzele, expansive voice regal bearing reminds Six, often similarly reserved. much keeps happening Francine — picked perform radio somehow almost immediately gets part Broadway show — perpetually reacting things. might look supporting characters take slack, often musicals, also frustratingly generic predictable plots touch everything homophobia horrors Nazi Germany surface level.

Similar trips follow tourist spots, like Grand Central Terminal’s whispering gallery, Metropolitan Museum Art, Carnegie Hall, Jimmy Francine nominally need reason other.

Everyone’s play hits, musically municipally.
nothing wrong little New York boosterism. show little — frustrating lack critical perspective. New York, New York, city’s starting return war, musical’s marketing leaned implied similarity era recovery pandemic. It’s worthy cause get people excited city life again, it’s hard embrace run clichés offer. wanted something historically grounded nuanced — postwar boom made city succeed? — or, least, grit.

There’s little swearing, like neighbor shouting “Shut fuck up!” Jimmy Francine profess love right intermission, even that’s cuteified, “’Eyyy, I’m walkin’ here” variety. recurring metaphor major chord, elaborated upon Kander song Jimmy tells Francine need city music, money, love — phrase that’s corny come mouth character we’re told quintessential New Yawkah. may grown L.A., led believe, even broadest pop culture, skeptical cynical key New York values, too.

We’re see New York, New York, quotes, appears name song. It’s discomfiting, watch musical, see city scrubbed, packaged, sold back across stage audience paying Broadway-ticket prices. people, afford buy idea New York’s cuddly utopia.
