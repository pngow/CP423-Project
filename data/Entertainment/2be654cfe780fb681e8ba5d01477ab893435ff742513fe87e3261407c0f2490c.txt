much season Dave structured around protagonist’s search love, often find less interested Dave’s love life stuff: family, friends, fans. Accordingly, “The Storm” favorite episode season three far. It’s basically Platonic ideal Dave episode: funny, creepy, sneakily thoughtful, telling story specific Dave utilizing whole ensemble.
begins Lil Dicky show Mississippi, young woman named Meg (Melanie Ehrlich) first line. Meg classic stan, like less creepy (but passionate) version fan “Texas” made Lil Dicky head concrete. idol picks join stage, it’s dream come true — even called “fat whore” toxic male fans faze her. “It’s Lil Dicky show, right?” says, brushing Dave’s sincere apology backstage. “I get it.” It’s telling remark.
Dave eager make Meg, invites Memphis show, even allowing join tour bus since doesn’t car. long arrive pick remote ranch house, Category 3 hurricane moves roads closed, stranding Dave posse (minus Ally) Meg’s family rest episode.
another opportunity Dave comment play stereotypes South, sure, it’s totally free cliché. soon hear Meg’s Wi-Fi password “ILIVEFORHIM,” start see going: Meg belongs conservative Christian family, inevitably clash Dave’s tour family godless heathens. There’s tension air beginning, parents suspicious Dave’s intentions skeptical larger group, including Vaka (Natasha Alam), latest GaTa’s seemingly endless series sexual partners. us, feels like setup Get situation, it’s starting feel like them, too.
“The Storm” feints horror direction, mostly anxiety-inducing quick cutting thescore, pulsing bass eerie strings. Every family member creepy way: Meg’s father cold, mother stern, Bible-quoting brother, Aaron (Alexander Poncio), looks like could break Dave half even without chainsaw. creepy little girl creepy grandma complete picture, latter providing episode’s outrageous moment exposes gets pleasured family dog. (By comparison, repeatedly mistaking Mike “Richard” small potatoes.)
what’s upsetting Dave isn’t numerous red flags piling up. can’t stop thinking Meg told parents came home: loves world dancing, parents think it’s un-Christian. made take TikTok account she’d upload videos dancing bedroom. Dave, perhaps greater injustice stifling someone’s creativity, makes mission change Meg’s parents’ minds.
It’s clear early Dave get way: pushing Meg’s parents far letting down. unlike Dave episodes (especially “Harrison Ave” season), Dave’s misguided persistence coming right place time. It’s cringey watch directly confront Meg’s parents dinner table, arguing there’s nothing evil sexuality drawing attention body dance. He’s right, isn’t productive argument everyone set beliefs: Dancing creates lust leads temptation, addictive cycle pleasure makes lose soul, that’s that. Dave really fucks speaking Meg, claiming doesn’t even believe Christianity standards live by. She’s right tell off.
Dave set straight, episode pivots deal subplot developing primarily background episode (and season overall): GaTa’s sex addiction. comes forefront Vaka storms (ha) calls someone else keep company. soon Vaka sees Graciela, attacks, leading scuffle ends Mike Dave yelling GaTa.
Maybe it’ll lose power eventually, GaTa getting real emotions always reliably moving, especially knowing much backstory parallels real-life man. instance surprising moment makes sense think back frequency GaTa’s sexual references recently. Crying admits much can’t take alone even night, Gata mentions last steady girlfriend left abortion. crucially, biological mom chose drugs him, something affects day. “Why love woman?” asks. “My mom didn’t love whole life.”
Throughout this, Meg’s mother (Dendrie Taylor) surprising source comfort, assuring GaTa God never abandon praying holds hand. It’s sign should’ve apparent Dave beginning: People complicated, surprise you. family hold mortifying views, Meg’s parents wrong take away loves? course. capable kindness empathy sometimes, undeniable comfort religion? Also yes. Besides, Meg may parents’ thumb, never get sense she’s truly unhappy life has. loves family faith keep steady, even experiences people would struggle handle.
Meg acknowledges next morning tells Dave doesn’t need save her; she’s already saved. really like give-and-take happens here: Meg teaches Dave valuable lesson, Dave’s perspective means lot her, too, despite numerous faux pas, real advice offer. “Only started exactly love life feel semblance spirit,” says. circumstances differed Meg’s, people told pursue rapping, wouldn’t didn’t ignore them.
parents still watching, Meg say good-bye Dave “mind hug” — one genuinely adorable TV moments I’ve seen while. then, lest fear scene getting gooey, get perfect ending joke: Aaron approaches Dave let know listened music actually loves “it’s fucking cool hear someone who’s proud white.” Every artist good fans bad fans, persona like Lil Dicky, there’s even bigger risk misunderstood. Aaron stand-in worst toxic Lil Dicky’s audience, series real life — type person booed Meg opening scene.
Except reveal isn’t true ending. episode Dave’s best fans worst fans, focus Meg, first last character see onscreen. tour bus pulls away, director Shannon Murphy pans end shot Meg dancing bedroom TikTok, bursting joy every twist turn body. show called Dave, “The Storm” much artist fan. final moments, it’s gets spotlight. Maybe one day she’ll superstar, maybe not, that’s point. moment, she’s young woman alone Mississippi, staring camera letting everything else go, that’s enough.
