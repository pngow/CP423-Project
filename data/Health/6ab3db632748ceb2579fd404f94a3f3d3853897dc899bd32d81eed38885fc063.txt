gene variant permanent change DNA sequence makes gene. type genetic change used known gene mutation, changes DNA always cause disease, thought gene variant accurate term. Variants affect one DNA building blocks (nucleotides) gene.
Gene variants inherited parent occur person’s lifetime:
Inherited (or hereditary) variants passed parent child present throughout person’s life virtually every cell body. variants also called germline variants present parent’s egg sperm cells, also called germ cells. egg sperm cell unite, resulting fertilized egg cell contains DNA parents. variants present DNA present cells child grows fertilized egg.
Non-inherited variants occur time person’s life present certain cells, every cell body. non-inherited variants typically occur somatic cells (cells sperm egg cells), often referred somatic variants. variants cannot passed next generation. Non-inherited variants caused environmental factors ultraviolet radiation sun occur error made DNA copies cell division.
genetic changes described new (de novo) variants; variants recognized child either parent. cases, variant occurs parent’s egg sperm cell present cells. cases, variant occurs fertilized egg shortly egg sperm cells unite. (It often impossible tell exactly de novo variant happened.) fertilized egg divides, resulting cell growing embryo variant. De novo variants one explanation genetic disorders affected child variant every cell body, parents not, family history disorder.
Variants acquired development lead situation called mosaicism, set cells body different genetic makeup others. mosaicism, genetic change present parent’s egg sperm cells, fertilized egg, happens later, anytime embryonic development adulthood. cells grow divide, cells arise cell altered gene variant, cells not. proportion somatic cells gene variant others not, called somatic mosaicism. Depending variant many cells affected, somatic mosaicism may may cause health problems. proportion egg sperm cells variant others not, called germline mosaicism. situation, unaffected parent pass genetic condition child.
variants lead development disease, uncommon general population. variants occur often enough population considered common genetic variation. Several variants responsible differences people eye color, hair color, blood type. Although many common variations DNA negative effects person’s health, may influence risk developing certain disorders.
