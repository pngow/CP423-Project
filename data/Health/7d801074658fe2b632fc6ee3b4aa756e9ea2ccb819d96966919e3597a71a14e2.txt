BRCA Genetic Test
BRCA gene test?
BRCA gene test uses sample blood, saliva (spit), cells inside cheek look changes BRCA1 BRCA2 genes may increase risk cancer. Changes genes called gene variants mutations. gene variants harmful.
Genes parts DNA inherit parents. carry information controls look like body works. BRCA genes repair damaged DNA cells protect getting certain types cancer. harmful variant BRCA genes, may work properly. increases risk getting cancer.
common cancers linked harmful BRCA variants are:
Breast cancer. BRCA short breast cancer gene. increased risk breast cancer mostly affects females. breast cancer risk males harmful BRCA variant higher males.
Ovarian cancer. cancer female reproductive glands eggs form.
Prostate cancer. cancer male reproductive gland makes fluid semen.
used for?
test used find harmful changes BRCA1 BRCA2 genes increase risk getting certain cancers, especially breast, ovarian, prostate, pancreatic cancer.
need BRCA gene test?
Harmful BRCA gene variants rare. affect 0.2 percent U.S. population. So, BRCA testing recommended people.
family members likely BRCA1 BRCA2 variant either side family strong history breast ovarian cancer. concerned may harmful variant BRCA1 BRCA2 gene, health care provider genetic counselor review personal family health history see need test.
general, important talk provider BRCA testing personal family health history includes:
Cancer ovaries, fallopian tubes (tubes connecting ovaries uterus), peritoneum (tissue covers belly organs).
Prostate cancer spreads parts body (metastatic cancer).
Pancreatic cancer.
Ashkenazi (Eastern European) Jewish ancestry. BRCA variants much common group compared general population. also common people parts Europe, including Iceland, Norway, Denmark.
relative already diagnosed harmful gene variant BRCA1 BRCA2.
think family health history, consider breast, ovarian, prostate, pancreatic cancers sides family. consider health grandparents, parents, aunts uncles, siblings, half-siblings, nieces nephews, grandchildren.
happens BRCA gene test?
BRCA test use either sample blood, saliva, cheek swab.
blood test: health care professional take blood sample vein arm, using small needle. needle inserted, small amount blood collected test tube vial. may feel little sting needle goes out. usually takes less five minutes.
saliva test: spit container use cotton pad soak saliva.
cheek swab: health care professional wipe inside cheek small tool remove cells. may option yourself.
at-home test kit available buy without prescription. allows collect saliva sample send lab testing. test checks three common harmful variants BRCA genes. 1000 known variants. So, home test can't rule possibility variant. Ask provider whether at-home test right you.

results mean?
provider genetic counselor need explain results affect risk certain cancers. That's meaning test results depends exact type variant personal family health history.
general, results may reported using terms:
negative (normal) result means test find harmful changes BRCA genes. affects cancer risk depends whether already cancer whether member family harmful BRCA variant.
uncertain result may also called "variant uncertain significance (VUS)". means variant BRCA genes found, researchers know whether variant causes cancer.
positive result may also called "likely pathogenic variant." means harmful gene variant known increase risk certain cancers. test cannot tell whether develop cancer.
