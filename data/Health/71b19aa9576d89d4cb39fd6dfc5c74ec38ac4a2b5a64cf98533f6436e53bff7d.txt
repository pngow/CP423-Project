electrocardiogram (EKG) test simple, painless, quick test records heart's electrical activity. time heart beats, electrical signal travels heart. signal triggers heart's four chambers contract (squeeze) proper rhythm heart pump blood body.
EKG recording signals looks like wavy lines. provider read lines look abnormal heart activity may sign heart disease damage.
EKG show:
fast heart beating
Whether rhythm heartbeat steady irregular
strength timing electrical signals passing part heart
Sometimes information EKG help measure size position heart's chambers.
EKG often first test signs heart condition. may done provider's office, outpatient clinic, hospital surgery, part another heart test called stress test.
EKG test also called ECG. EKG based German spelling, elektrokardiogramm. EKG may preferred ECG avoid confusion EEG, test measures brain waves.
EKG tests mainly used people symptoms heart condition already diagnosed heart condition. generally used screen people symptoms unless increased risk developing heart disease. provider explain risk heart disease let know need EKG test. certain cases, provider may see cardiologist, doctor specializes heart diseases.
need EKG test?
may need EKG test symptoms heart condition, including:

EKG test takes minutes. generally includes steps:
lie exam table.
provider place several electrodes (small sensors stick skin) arms, legs, chest. provider may need shave body hair make sure electrodes stay on.
electrodes attached wires computer special EKG machine
lie still heart's electrical activity recorded computer printed paper EKG machine.
need anything prepare test?
need special preparations EKG test.
risks test?
little risk EKG. may feel little discomfort skin irritation electrodes removed. EKG send electricity body. records electrical signals heart, there's risk electric shock.
results mean?

Holter monitor size small camera. usually wear belt strap around neck day two. Wires clothes attach electrodes stick chest. monitor records heart's electrical signals whole time wearing it. may asked keep diary symptoms test period. test period, remove monitor return according instructions. provider review recording heart's electrical activity monitor.
event monitor records heart's electrical activity press button device detects abnormal heart activity. two main types event monitors:
Event monitors wear carry you. wear monitors chest wrist. monitors designed carry. symptoms, hold monitor chest. event monitors may used weeks months. wirelessly transmit information heart provider. Others must returned provider examine recorded information.
Event monitors inserted skin chest. called implantable event monitors. put skin minor surgery that's often done doctor's office. monitors track heart's electrical activity years. may need type EKG monitor stroke frequent fainting, provider found cause.
