beta-2 microglobulin tumor marker test?
beta-2 microglobulin tumor marker test measures amount protein called beta-2 microglobulin (B2M) body fluids. test usually uses sample blood. may also done using urine (pee) rare cases cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).
B2M type tumor marker. Tumor markers substances often made cancer cells normal cells response cancer body. B2M found cells body. Normally, small amounts B2M blood urine. High levels B2M body fluids often caused blood bone marrow cancers:
beta-2 microglobulin tumor marker test can't diagnose cancer condition. That's many conditions cause high levels B2M. already diagnosed one blood bone marrow cancers, B2M test provide important information cancer including:
much cancer body fast growing
cancer may behave future
much treatment helping
information help health care provider plan care.
used for?
beta-2 microglobulin tumor marker test often used diagnosed certain cancers bone marrow blood. Testing B2M levels help:
Find much cancer body
Predict cancer develop
Pick treatment check whether working
Check whether cancer spread brain and/or spinal cord (This done symptoms.)
need beta-2 microglobulin tumor marker test?
diagnosed multiple myeloma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, certain types lymphoma, may need B2M test find serious disease is. B2M testing help monitor cancer check whether treatment working.
multiple myeloma, may need B2M test see whether cancer spreading. test urine sample may also needed check whether disease affecting kidneys.
happens beta-2 microglobulin tumor marker test?
beta-2 microglobulin test usually uses sample blood. certain cases, may need provide 24-hour urine sample, means collecting urine full day. provider suspects cancer spread brain spine, may cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis.
blood test, health care professional take blood sample vein arm, using small needle. needle inserted, small amount blood collected test tube vial. may feel little sting needle goes out. usually takes less five minutes.

urine test, known risk.
CSF analysis, little risk spinal tap. may feel little pinch pressure needle inserted. test, may feel pain tenderness back bleeding needle inserted. may also get headache. headache may last several hours week more. provider may suggest treatment relieve pain.
results mean?
B2M levels measured learn cancer:
higher B2M levels, cancer body. Higher levels linked cancers tend grow faster./li>
multiple myeloma, higher levels B2M linked kidney problems.
B2M levels measured check well treatment working, provider may look several test results time look trend:
Increasing B2M levels may mean treatment working.
Decreasing B2M levels may mean treatment working.
B2M levels change may mean disease stable gotten better worse.
questions test results, talk provider.
