chorionic villus sampling (CVS)?
Chorionic villus sampling (CVS) test pregnant women checks chorionic villi, tiny finger-like growths found placenta. placenta organ nourishes unborn baby uterus. test looks abnormalities baby's chromosomes. Chromosomes parts cells contain genes. Genes parts DNA passed mother father. Normally, people total 46 chromosomes.
Chorionic villi contain chromosomes unborn baby. So, CVS test show baby extra chromosome missing damaged chromosome. chromosome differences cause serious health problems.
CVS prenatal diagnostic test, means almost always tell sure whether unborn baby chromosome disorder. different prenatal screening test, shows whether baby increased risk serious health problem.
names: CVS test
used for?
CVS testing used diagnose chromosome problems genetic diseases unborn baby. include:
syndrome, disorder causes intellectual disabilities, certain physical features, various health problems.
Cystic fibrosis, disease causes mucus buildup lungs organs, making hard breathe.
Tay-Sachs disease, disorder causes fatty proteins build brain. affects sight, hearing, mental development. children Tay-Sachs die age 5.
CVS testing accurate done early pregnancy, 10th 13th week. diagnose certain genetic diseases. CVS test diagnose screen birth defects neural tube defects, conditions cause abnormal development developing baby's brain and/or spine. Different tests, including alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) blood test, used screen diagnose birth defects.
need CVS test?
may need CVS testing higher risk baby chromosome disorder. Risk factors include:
Age. Women age 35 older higher risk baby syndrome another genetic disorder.
Family history genetic disorder
another child genetic disorder
may also need CVS testing abnormal results prenatal screening test.
happens CVS test?
two types CVS tests:
Transabdominal sample taken abdomen.
Transcervical. sample taken cervix. cervix lower, narrow end uterus opens vagina.
provider use ultrasound check baby's position guide procedure (transabdominal transcervical). Ultrasound imaging test uses sound waves create pictures.
transabdominal CVS, provider will:
Clean abdomen antiseptic.
Apply numbing medicine abdomen.
Insert long, thin needle abdomen uterus placenta. may feel cramping stinging sensation needle enters uterus.
Use needle withdraw sample tissue placenta.
Remove needle.
transcervical CVS, provider will:
Clean vagina cervix antiseptic
Use instrument called speculum gently spread apart sides vagina.
Insert thin tube vagina cervix placenta. may feel slight twinge cramping done.
Use tube gently suck sample tissue placenta.
Remove tube.
need anything prepare test?
morning test, may asked drink extra fluids urinate. fill bladder, may help move uterus better position procedure.
risks test?
CVS generally considered safe procedure, risks. include:
Rh sensitization. condition body makes antibodies (proteins made immune system) attack baby's red blood cells. diagnosed pregnancy, easily treatable.
Limb defects baby (this rare)
results mean?
CVS test results usually available within two weeks.
results normal, may mean baby chromosome genetic disorder, syndrome cystic fibrosis. Occasionally, CVS test results unclear, provider may recommend amniocentesis. Amniocentesis another prenatal diagnostic test. performed 15th 20th week pregnancy.
questions results, talk health care provider.
anything else need know CVS testing?
chromosome genetic disorders require baby extensive medical treatments. disorders may treatable. CVS test results normal, talk health care provider options decisions may need make. may also help speak genetic counselor get results. genetic counselor specially trained professional genetics help understand results mean.
