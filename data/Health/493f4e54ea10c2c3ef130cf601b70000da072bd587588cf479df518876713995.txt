estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor (ER/PR) tests?
Estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor (ER/PR) tests used help guide breast cancer treatment. Receptors proteins attach certain substances. ER/PR tests look receptors attach hormones estrogen progesterone sample breast cancer tissue. Estrogen progesterone play key roles woman's sexual development reproductive functions. Men also hormones, much smaller amounts.
70 percent breast cancers women receptors attach estrogen and/or progesterone. 80 percent 90 percent breast cancers men receptors. Breast cancers estrogen and/or progesterone receptors include following types:
ER-positive (ER+): Cancers estrogen receptors (ER)
PR-positive (PR+): Cancers progesterone receptors (PR)
Hormone receptor-positive (HR+): Cancers one types receptors.
Breast cancers without ER PR receptors known HR-negative (HR-).
ER/PR tests show whether ER and/or PR receptors breast cancer cells. Test results frequently referred hormone receptor status. hormone receptor status shows one receptors cancer cells, may respond well certain types treatments.
names: ER/PR IHC testing, hormone receptor status
used for?
ER/PR tests used guide treatment breast cancer patients.
need ER/PR test?
may need test diagnosed breast cancer. Knowing hormone receptor status help health care provider decide treat it. ER-positive, PR-positive, HR-positive cancer, drugs lower hormone levels stop hormones fueling cancer growth effective. HR-negative cancer, types drugs work you.
happens ER/PR testing?
provider need take sample breast tissue procedure called breast biopsy. three main types breast biopsies:
Fine needle aspiration biopsy, uses thin needle remove sample breast cells fluid
Core needle biopsy, uses larger needle remove sample
Surgical biopsy, removes sample minor, outpatient procedure
Fine needle aspiration core needle biopsies usually include following steps:
lay side sit exam table.
health care provider clean biopsy site inject anesthetic, feel pain procedure.
area numb, provider insert either fine aspiration needle core biopsy needle biopsy site remove sample tissue fluid.
may feel little pressure sample withdrawn.
Pressure applied biopsy site bleeding stops.
provider apply sterile bandage biopsy site.
surgical biopsy, surgeon make small cut skin remove part breast lump. surgical biopsy sometimes done lump can't reached needle biopsy. Surgical biopsies usually include following steps.
lie operating table. IV (intravenous line) may placed arm hand.
may given medicine, called sedative, help relax.
given local general anesthesia, feel pain procedure.
local anesthesia, health care provider inject biopsy site medicine numb area.
general anesthesia, specialist called anesthesiologist give medicine unconscious procedure.
biopsy area numb unconscious, surgeon make small cut breast remove part lump. tissue around lump may also removed.
cut skin closed stitches adhesive strips.
need anything prepare test?
need special preparations getting local anesthesia (numbing biopsy site). getting general anesthesia, probably need fast (not eat drink) several hours surgery. surgeon give specific instructions. Also, getting sedative general anesthesia, sure arrange someone drive home. may groggy confused wake procedure.
risks test?
may little bruising bleeding biopsy site. Sometimes site gets infected. happens, treated antibiotics. surgical biopsy may cause additional pain discomfort. health care provider may recommend prescribe medicine help feel better.
results mean?
results show whether hormone receptor-positive negative type cancer. hormone receptor status positive, test also shows levels estrogen and/or progesterone receptors. higher levels receptors, effective certain medicines may treating cancer. hormone receptor status negative, medicines effective.
questions results, talk health care provider.
anything else need know ER/PR tests?
HER2 testing often done time ER/PR testing. hormone receptor cancers also HER2-positive. HER2 protein found surface breast cells. Treatments HER2-positive breast cancer effective effective HER2-negative cancers.
