arterial blood gas test?
arterial blood gas (ABG) test measures amount oxygen carbon dioxide blood. also checks acidity blood. called acid-base balance pH level. blood sample taken artery, blood vessel carries oxygen-rich blood lungs body.
ABG test, blood oxygen measurement shows well lungs move oxygen air blood breath in. carbon dioxide measurement shows well lungs remove carbon dioxide blood breath out.
Carbon dioxide acidic waste product body makes. blood tissues become even slightly acidic basic (alkaline), seriously affect many organs even become life-threatening.
lungs kidneys much work keep acid-base balance normal. So, acid-base measurement ABG test help diagnose monitor conditions affect lungs kidneys well many conditions may upset acid-base balance.
happens blood oxygen level test?
blood tests take sample vein. test, health care provider take sample blood artery. That's blood artery higher oxygen levels blood vein.
sample usually taken artery inside wrist, may taken artery arm groin. newborn, sample may taken baby's heel umbilical cord shortly birth.
blood sample taken wrist, provider first test blood circulation. provider hold wrist apply pressure arteries cut blood flow hand several seconds. provider let go wrist check quickly blood flow returns hand. blood flow normal, provider collect blood sample.
blood sample taken artery tends uncomfortable blood tests, use vein. So, provider may apply numbing medicine skin first. provider insert needle syringe artery remove blood.
syringe full, provider bandage puncture site. Pressure applied site least 5 minutes stop bleeding.
need anything prepare test?
take blood thinners, including aspirin, ask health care provider whether stop taking test. tell provider medicines supplements take. stop taking medicines unless provider tells to.
oxygen therapy, oxygen may turned 20 minutes test. done breathe without oxygen therapy.
risks test?
little risk blood oxygen level test. may bleeding, bruising, soreness spot needle put in. rarely, needle may damage nerve artery. may told avoid lifting heavy objects 24 hours test.
results mean?
ABG test results involve many body systems affect other. many health conditions cause abnormal results. reasons, best provider explain results mean health.
Partial pressure oxygen (PaO2). measures pressure oxygen that's dissolved blood. helps show well oxygen moves lungs bloodstream.
Partial pressure carbon dioxide (PaCO2). measures amount carbon dioxide blood. also shows easily carbon dioxide move body.
Acid-base balance (pH level). measures acidity blood. much acid called acidosis. much base (alkaline) called alkalosis. conditions symptoms problems upset acid-base balance body.
ABG test alone usually can't provide final diagnosis. So, results normal, provider likely order tests make diagnosis. general, abnormal results may mean problem lungs kidneys metabolic disorder. Metabolic disorders affect body uses food energy. Certain medicines may also upset acid-base balance lead abnormal ABG test results.
anything else need know blood oxygen level tests?
Another type test, called pulse oximetry, check blood oxygen saturation levels. small clip-like device, called pulse oximeter, usually attached finger. device tells percentage red blood cells full oxygen. Pulse oximetry may useful blood oxygen levels concern. Ask provider test right you.
