Doppler ultrasound?
Doppler ultrasound imaging test uses sound waves show blood moving blood vessels. regular ultrasound also uses sound waves create images structures inside body, can't show blood flow.
Doppler ultrasound works measuring sound waves reflected moving objects, red blood cells. known Doppler effect.
different types Doppler ultrasound tests. include:
Color Doppler. type Doppler uses computer change sound waves different colors. colors show speed direction blood flow real time.
Power Doppler, newer type color Doppler. provide detail blood flow standard color Doppler. cannot show direction blood flow, important cases.
Spectral Doppler. test shows blood flow information graph, rather color pictures. help show much blood vessel blocked.
Duplex Doppler. test uses standard ultrasound take images blood vessels organs. computer turns images graph, spectral Doppler.
Continuous wave Doppler. test, sound waves sent received continuously. allows accurate measurement blood flows faster speeds.
names: Doppler ultrasonography
used for?
Doppler ultrasound tests used help health care providers find condition reducing blocking blood flow. may also used help diagnose certain heart diseases. test often used to:
Check heart function. often done along electrocardiogram, test measures electrical signals heart.
Look blockages blood flow. Blocked blood flow legs cause condition called deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
Check blood vessel damage defects structure heart.
need Doppler ultrasound?
may need Doppler ultrasound symptoms reduced blood flow heart disease. Symptoms vary depending condition causing problem. common blood flow conditions symptoms below.
Symptoms peripheral arterial disease (PAD) include:
Numbness weakness legs
Painful cramping hips leg muscles walking climbing stairs
stroke. stroke, health care provider may order special kind Doppler test, called transcranial Doppler, check blood flow brain.
injury blood vessels.
treated blood flow disorder.
pregnant provider thinks unborn baby might blood flow problem. provider may suspect problem unborn baby smaller stage pregnancy certain health problems. include sickle cell disease preeclampsia, type high blood pressure affects pregnant women.
happens Doppler ultrasound?
Doppler ultrasound usually includes following steps:
lie table, exposing area body that's tested.
health care provider spread special gel skin area.
provider move wand-like device, called transducer, area.
device sends sound waves body.
movement blood cells causes change pitch sound waves. may hear swishing pulse-like sounds procedure.
waves recorded turned images graphs monitor.
test over, provider wipe gel body.
test takes 30-60 minutes complete.
need anything prepare test?
prepare Doppler ultrasound, may need to:
Remove clothing jewelry area body getting tested.
Avoid cigarettes products nicotine two hours test. Nicotine causes blood vessels narrow, affect results.
certain types Doppler tests, may asked fast (not eat drink) several hours test.
health care provider let know need anything prepare test.
