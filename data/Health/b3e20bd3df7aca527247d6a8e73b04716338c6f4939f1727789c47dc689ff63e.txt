syndrome tests?
syndrome condition person born extra chromosome extra piece chromosome. condition causes problems development, thinking, learning, physical health. syndrome tests help find chromosome disorder unborn babies.
Chromosomes tiny "packages" cells contain genes. Genes carry information, called DNA, controls look like body works. Normally, born set 46 chromosomes cell. chromosomes grouped 23 pairs. pair two chromosomes, one coming parent.
people syndrome extra copy chromosome 21 cells. common form syndrome called trisomy 21. "Trisomy" means three copies chromosome cells instead usual two. less common types syndrome, person may have:
extra piece chromosome 21 attached another chromosome (translocation syndrome)
extra chromosome 21 some, cells (mosaic syndrome)
extra chromosome affects way baby's brain body develop. symptoms may range mild severe. Children syndrome usually problems thinking learning. may start talking later children.
two basic types tests help find syndrome pregnancy:
Prenatal screening tests show whether unborn baby higher lower chance syndrome. screening test shows baby could syndrome, need another test find sure. types screening tests syndrome:
First trimester screening includes:
blood test check blood "markers" certain proteins may linked higher risk syndrome
ultrasound image look fluid back baby's neck, may sign syndrome
Second trimester screening includes blood tests check levels several markers blood may sign syndrome. test may check three markers (a triple screen test) four markers (a quadruple screen test).
Combined (or integrated) testing uses results first second trimester screening tests estimate baby's risk syndrome.
Cell-free fetal DNA newer test checks sample blood unusually large amounts material chromosome 21. test done early ten weeks. recommended you:
low risk baby syndrome
pregnant two babies.
Prenatal diagnostic tests diagnose rule syndrome checking chromosomes sample cells. tests small risk causing miscarriage, they're often done screening test shows unborn baby could syndrome. Diagnostic tests syndrome include:
Amniocentesis. test takes sample amniotic fluid surrounds unborn baby uterus. fluid contains cells baby tested. test usually done weeks 15 20 pregnancy.
Chorionic villus sampling (CVS). CVS collects tissue parts placenta called chorionic villi. placenta organ grows uterus provide nutrients oxygen baby. Cells chorionic villi usually chromosomes unborn baby. CVS may done weeks 10 13 pregnancy.
Percutaneous umbilical blood sampling (PUBS), also called cordocentesis. test removes sample baby's blood umbilical cord. PUBS gives accurate diagnosis syndrome pregnancy, commonly used. That's risks tests can't done later pregnancy, usually weeks 18 22.
tests used for?
syndrome tests used:
pregnancy to:
Estimate unborn baby's risk syndrome.
Confirm diagnosis syndrome unborn baby.
birth diagnose rule syndrome newborn shows signs condition. Usually, karyotype test done sample baby's blood. test checks number structure baby's chromosomes.
need syndrome test?
may need syndrome testing pregnancy high risk baby syndrome. risk may higher if:
age 35 older got pregnant. risk baby syndrome increases age.
child syndrome diagnosis syndrome past pregnancy.
family history syndrome.
ultrasound unborn baby showed possible sign syndrome.
may choose tested even high risk baby syndrome. provider genetic counselor help consider pros cons testing.
happens syndrome testing?
blood test, health care professional take blood sample vein arm, using small needle. needle inserted, small amount blood collected test tube vial. may feel little sting needle goes out. usually takes less five minutes.
first trimester ultrasound, health care professional move ultrasound wand-like device belly. Ultrasound uses sound waves make image unborn baby.
amniocentesis, provider inserts hollow needle belly uterus withdraw sample amniotic fluid.
chorionic villus sampling (CVS), provider collects sample tissue placenta either needle that's inserted belly tube that's inserted vagina.
percutaneous umbilical blood sampling (PUBS), provider inserts hollow needle belly umbilical cord uterus. small blood sample removed vein cord.
need anything prepare tests?
Blood tests ultrasounds usually require preparation.
CVS amniocentesis, may need drink extra fluid urinate test bladder full.
PUBS test 23 weeks pregnancy, may need fast (not eat drink) several hours test.
risks tests?
Blood tests ultrasounds little risk. blood test, may slight pain bruising spot needle put in, symptoms go away quickly.
amniocentesis CVS, may feel mild stinging cramping. tests safe, slight risk causing miscarriage.
PUBS may cause brief discomfort. test slightly higher risk causing serious problems amniocentesis CVS. Talk health care provider risks benefits testing syndrome.
results mean?
Results syndrome screening tests show risk baby syndrome:
positive screening test result means baby's chance syndrome higher average. test results may include number describes high risk is. high risk mean baby syndrome. could still deliver healthy baby chromosomal defects disorders.
negative/normal screening test result means baby unlikely syndrome. screening test can't guarantee baby syndrome.
Whether screening tests normal, may choose one diagnostic tests. Diagnostic tests usually tell whether baby syndrome. diagnostic tests cannot predict much syndrome affect baby's health abilities.
may find helpful speak genetic counselor testing get results. Genetic counselors specially trained help weigh risks benefits testing. also help understand results mean make informed decisions.
