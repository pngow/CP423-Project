BCR-ABL genetic test?
BCR-ABL genetic test looks genetic mutation (change) specific chromosome.
Chromosomes parts cells contain genes. Genes parts DNA passed mother father. carry information determines unique traits, height eye color.
People normally 46 chromosomes, divided 23 pairs, cell. One pair chromosomes comes mother, pair comes father.
BCR-ABL mutation formed combination two genes, known BCR ABL. sometimes called fusion gene.
BCR gene normally chromosome number 22.
ABL gene normally chromosome number 9.
BCR-ABL mutation happens pieces BCR ABL genes break switch places.
piece chromosome 9 breaks includes part ABL gene. piece moves chromosome 22, part ABL gene attaches BCR gene. merged gene called BCR-ABL fusion gene.
changed chromosome 22, contains BCR-ABL gene, called Philadelphia chromosome that's city researchers first discovered it.
BCR-ABL gene type mutation inherited parents. type somatic mutation, means born it. get later life.
BCR-ABL gene shows patients certain types leukemia, cancer bone marrow white blood cells. BCR-ABL found almost patients type leukemia called chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Another name CML chronic myelogenous leukemia. names refer disease.
Certain cancer medicines especially effective treating leukemia patients BCR-ABL gene mutation. medicines also fewer side effects cancer treatments. medicines effective treating different types leukemia cancers.
names: BCR-ABL1, BCR-ABL1 fusion, Philadelphia chromosome
used for?
BCR-ABL test often used diagnose rule chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) specific form acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) called Ph-positive ALL. Ph-positive means Philadelphia chromosome found. test used diagnose types leukemia.
test may also used to:
See cancer treatment effective.
See patient developed resistance certain treatment. means treatment used effective longer working.
need BCR-ABL genetic test?
may need BCR-ABL test symptoms chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) Ph-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). include:
people CML Ph-positive symptoms, mild symptoms, especially early stages disease. health care provider may order test complete blood count blood test showed results normal. also let provider know symptoms concern you. CML Ph-positive easier treat found early.
may also need test currently treated CML Ph-positive ALL. test help provider see treatment working.
happens BCR-ABL genetic test?
BCR-ABL test usually blood test procedure called bone marrow aspiration biopsy.
getting blood test, health care professional take blood sample vein arm, using small needle. needle inserted, small amount blood collected test tube vial. may feel little sting needle goes out. usually takes less five minutes.
getting bone marrow aspiration biopsy, procedure may include following steps:
lie side stomach, depending bone used testing. bone marrow tests taken hip bone.
body covered cloth, area around testing site showing.
site cleaned antiseptic.
get injection numbing solution. may sting.
area numb, health care provider take sample. need lie still tests.
bone marrow aspiration, usually performed first, health care provider insert needle bone pull bone marrow fluid cells. may feel sharp brief pain needle inserted.
bone marrow biopsy, health care provider use special tool twists bone take sample bone marrow tissue. may feel pressure site sample taken.
takes 10 minutes perform tests.
test, health care provider cover site bandage.
Plan someone drive home, since may given sedative tests, may make drowsy.
need anything prepare test?
usually need special preparations blood bone marrow test.
risks test?
little risk blood test. may slight pain bruising spot needle put in, symptoms go away quickly.
bone marrow test, may feel stiff sore injection site. usually goes away days. health care provider may recommend prescribe pain reliever help.
results mean?
results show BCR-ABL gene, well abnormal amount white blood cells, probably diagnosed chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) Ph-positive, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).
currently treated CML Ph-positive ALL, results may show:
amount BCR-ABL blood bone marrow increasing. may mean treatment working and/or become resistant certain treatment.
amount BCR-ABL blood bone marrow decreasing. may mean treatment working.
amount BCR-ABL blood bone marrow increased decreased. may mean disease stable.
questions results, talk health care provider.
anything else need know BCR-ABL genetic test?
Treatments chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) Ph-positive, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) successful patients forms leukemia. important see health care provider regularly make sure treatments continue work. become resistant treatment, provider may recommend types cancer therapy.
