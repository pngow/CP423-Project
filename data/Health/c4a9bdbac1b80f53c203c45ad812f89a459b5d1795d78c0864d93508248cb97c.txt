C-Peptide Test
C-peptide test?
test measures level C-peptide sample blood urine (pee). Measuring C-peptide accurate way find much insulin body making.
Insulin hormone pancreas makes. helps blood glucose (blood sugar) get cells, used energy. helps keep blood glucose healthy levels.
process making insulin, pancreas produces C-peptide. C-peptide insulin enter bloodstream time equal amounts. C-peptide affect blood glucose levels, stays blood longer insulin, easier measure accurately.
C-peptide test provide important information help understand, monitor, and/or treat disorders involve well body makes insulin, hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) diabetes.
used for?
Find cause hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). types hypoglycemia linked high insulin levels. C-peptide test tell whether much insulin involved condition. Possible causes hypoglycemia include:
Manage diabetes treatment. type 1 type 2 diabetes, treatment decisions may depend knowing much insulin pancreas producing. C-peptide test provide accurate measurement, even take insulin diabetes. That's C-peptide levels depend much insulin pancreas makes. affected insulin take.
Monitor treatment tumor pancreas, called insulinoma (uncommon). tumors make much insulin cause low blood sugar. almost always benign (not cancer) usually removed surgery.
find whether type 1 type 2 diabetes diagnosis uncertain. Usually, health care provider diagnose type diabetes have. certain cases, hard tell sure. diabetes diagnosis uncertain 3 years, C-peptide test may needed.
need C-peptide test?
may need C-peptide test if:
diagnosed hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) know what's causing it.
diabetes you:
Take insulin, provider considering changing treatment.
type 2 diabetes, provider wants see need start taking insulin.
hypoglycemia, could caused taking much diabetes medicines.
diagnosed pancreatic tumor (insulinoma). C-peptide test help monitor condition treatment.
happens C-peptide test?
C-peptide test usually uses sample blood. test may also done sample urine collected 24-hour period.
blood test, health care professional take blood sample vein arm, using small needle. needle inserted, small amount blood collected test tube vial. may feel little sting needle goes out. usually takes less five minutes.
24-hour urine sample test, given special container collect urine instructions collect store samples. provider tell time start. test generally includes following steps:
begin, urinate toilet usual. collect urine. Write time urinated.
next 24 hours, collect urine container.
collection period, store urine container refrigerator cooler ice.
24 hours starting test, try urinate can. last urine collection test.
Return container urine provider's office laboratory instructed.
need anything prepare test?

risks test?
little risk blood test. may slight pain bruising spot needle put in, symptoms go away quickly. known risks urine test.
results mean?
meaning results depends age, health, medicines take, results tests, blood glucose test. general:
high level C-peptide usually means body making much insulin. Conditions cause high insulin levels include:
treated insulin-producing tumor pancreas, decrease C-peptide levels means treatment working. increase C-peptide may mean tumor back.
