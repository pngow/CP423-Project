AFP (alpha-fetoprotein) tumor marker test?
AFP tumor marker test blood test measures level AFP (alpha-fetoprotein) sample blood. usually used help diagnose certain types cancer check well treatment working.
AFP protein liver makes cells growing dividing make new cells. AFP normally high unborn babies. birth, AFP levels drop low. Healthy children adults pregnant little AFP blood.
AFP non-pregnant people mainly measured tumor marker. Tumor markers substances often made cancer cells normal cells response cancer. High levels AFP sign cancer liver, ovaries testicles.
AFP tumor marker test cannot used screen diagnose cancer. That's conditions increase AFP levels, including liver diseases cancer. people liver, ovarian, testicular cancer normal AFP levels. So, AFP tumor marker test can't rule cancer sure. used tests exams, AFP tumor marker testing help diagnose monitor cancers cause high AFP levels.
names: total AFP, alpha-fetoprotein-L3 Percent
used for?
AFP tumor marker test may used diagnosis and/or treatment cancer liver, ovaries, testicles make high levels AFP. used to:
Help confirm rule cancer diagnosis used exams tests.
Predict cancer may behave time.
Monitor cancer treatment. AFP levels often go cancer growing go treatment working.
Check whether cancer returned treatment.
certain cases, results AFP tumor marker test may used guide treatment choices specific types cancer. test may also used monitor health chronic (long lasting) hepatitis cirrhosis liver. conditions cancer, increase risk developing liver cancer.
need AFP tumor marker test?
may need AFP tumor marker test if:
physical exam and/or tests suggest may cancer liver, ovaries, testicles.
currently treated cancer causes high AFP levels. Measuring AFP test show well treatment working.
completed treatment cancer increased AFP level. may need AFP tumor marker test time time check whether cancer coming back.
chronic hepatitis cirrhosis, higher risk developing liver cancer. high level AFP sudden increase early sign liver cancer. medical experts recommend measuring AFP levels screen cancer diseases. But, health care providers may still use AFP tumor marker test tests watch liver cancer.
happens AFP tumor marker test?
health care professional take blood sample vein arm, using small needle. needle inserted, small amount blood collected test tube vial. may feel little sting needle goes out. usually takes less five minutes.
need anything prepare test?
need special preparations AFP tumor marker test.
risks test?
little risk blood test. may slight pain bruising spot needle put in, symptoms go away quickly.
results mean?
diagnosed cancer, test results show:
High levels AFP may sign cancer liver, ovaries, testicles. high AFP level mean cancer get cancer. Liver injury liver diseases cancer also cause high AFP levels. Less often, high levels AFP may sign cancers, including lymphoma lung cancer. provider use medical history test results make diagnosis.
Normal levels AFP mean less likely cancer causes high AFP levels. normal test result rule cancer people cancers normal AFP levels.
treated cancer increased AFP levels, may tested several times treatment. provider look AFP test results see levels changed time. results show:
AFP levels increasing, may mean treatment working.
AFP levels decreasing, may mean treatment working.
AFP levels stayed same, may mean disease stable gotten better worse.
finished treatment cancer caused high AFP levels test results are:
normal, may mean still cancer body.
Higher shortly treatment, may mean cancer growing again.
long-lasting liver disease that's cancer, may need tests check liver cancer test results show sudden increase AFP level high.
anything else need know AFP tumor marker test?
U.S., common AFP tumor marker test measures forms AFP blood. less common AFP test may used check risk liver cancer people chronic liver disease. measures form AFP called L3.
AFP-L3 percent test (AFP-L3%) compares amount L3 amount total AFP blood. portion L3 increases, may mean high risk developing serious form common liver cancer called hepatocellular carcinoma.
