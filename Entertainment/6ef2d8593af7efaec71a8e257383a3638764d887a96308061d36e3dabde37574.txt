premise, series would seem fairly standard take dead-white-girl narrative, Alison’s eventual unexplained death serving mystery heart plot. 2020 Alexis Schaitkin novel it’s based on, upends tropes offering kaleidoscope perspectives reconsider kind stories expect tragedies like these, gets center — aims to, anyway. Unfortunately, accumulation minor fumbles leaves could’ve incisive subversion familiar story feeling, instead, like replication it.
Adapted TV Leila Gerstein, Saint X unfolds primarily across two timelines. early 2000s, Thomases — dad Bill (Michael Park), mom Mia (Betsy Brandt), 7-year-old Claire (Kenlee Anaya Townsend) 18-year-old Alison — descend upon titular island week family fun, dream vacation turn nightmare Alison goes missing night scheduled return Westchester. Meanwhile, 2020s, Claire — going Emily, played Alycia Debnam-Carey — happens one night get cab driven Clive Richardson (Josh Bonzie), one men suspected never convicted killing Alison. months follow, begins stalk worm way life, increasingly consumed idea give answers sister long eluded her.
two halves, Saint X fares far better resort material. Though depiction titular island lacks rich detail made Schaitkin’s version leap page, benefits curiosity supporting characters surround central players. also displays bracing willingness dive uncomfortable conversations race, class sex raised uneven dynamic privileged tourists hotel staffers catering every need — piña coladas towels, also thrill flirtatious smile ego boost effusive compliment. Dee Rees (Pariah), helmed first episode, shows firm grasp perspective flip-flops guests help, eye silent loaded glances pass among them.
queen tourist set Alison, played Duchovny insouciant drawl makes character somehow seem she’s always snapping gum, even though she’s never actually chewing gum. Beautiful outgoing, Alison tends inspire adoration, desire, resentment combination thereof people meets.
She’s also, quickly learn, deeply insecure maddeningly oblivious — white girl determined prove she’s like white guests cannot see instinct makes another clueless white person. bus ride in, loudly castigates parents “hypocrisy” booking luxury vacay “an island people don’t even solid roofs heads.” It’s driver replies mild “Miss, island, people well fed happy,” even seems consider whether she’s projecting condescending assumptions onto people place doesn’t know all.
ultimate effort get “authentic” experience resort trip romantic pursuit Clive’s charismatic best friend Edwin (a luminous Jayden Elijah). Edwin sees Alison’s pretensions (“She’s funniest whitey you’ve landed yet. earnest. self-important,” friend laughs witnessing one interactions), reasons courting affections, revealed gradually season’s eight hourlong chapters. Still, plain fact Edwin Clive among last people seen Alison cast air suspicion around long local police chief ruled death accident, much way grief continues dog Emily decades Alison’s passing.
Emily Clive, Saint X serves two characters whose lives completely derailed Alison’s death, understandably cannot help haunted questions regrets hung ever since. (Clive’s sometimes manifest goat woman stalks nightmares, unnecessary detour full-on horror.) scenes set past take care flesh characters beyond present predicaments — with, instance, frequent flashbacks formative moments Edwin Clive’s childhood — present-day sequences feel artless singlemindedness. Clunky dialogue overbearing music cues take Saint X “downmarket White Lotus” “downmarket Law & Order: SVU.”
“I’m going make trust me. Like made trust him,” Emily announces one show’s groaningly obvious lines. queasy chemistry Clive Emily undermined series’ disinterest fleshing either beyond scars left behind night Alison died. Bonzie gives perhaps Saint X‘s moving performance older Clive, man beaten despair moves life like ghost. Yet need obscure really got night necessarily keeps distance series. Debnam-Carey, meanwhile, fine job modulating Emily’s gradual deterioration, often reduced yelling variations ideas nothing matters finding Alison died.
obsessive search answers would seem commentary way stories like Alison’s tend consumed expect get them. Saint X does, eventually, land definitive answer feels thoughtfully, deliberately anticlimactic. last scene, nothing Alison all, series aims shift understanding kind story we’ve watching along. feels like little little, little late. turns story centered first foremost around Alison — may entirely generic Alison fears be, doesn’t manage escape confines genre, either.
