Guy Ritchie Movies, Ranked
list originally published 2021. updated include Guy Ritchie’s recent films.
honestly difficult come modern filmmaker weirder, almost nonsensical, career Guy Ritchie’s. world person made Snatch Lock, Stock, Two Smoking Barrels even live plane human existence person made Aladdin? say nothing movie made starring then-wife Madonna.
Ritchie’s high-energy macho style is, obviously, everyone, another reason it’s remarkable transitioned easily big-budget Hollywood movies, Sherlock Holmes films Aladdin, far biggest hit. makes certain amount sense Ritchie’s movies, even better ones, aren’t really anything. pure sensation, style sake style. That’s always terrible thing: best, flicks rush whippets … even come accompanying loss brain cells. guy knows make movie move, comes handy, even you’re painting Smith blue. It’s particularly coherent career. blue-collar blokes might say: It’s living.
Here, ranking Ritchie’s films, worst best.
14. Swept Away (2002)
Considering obsessed tabloids marriage Madonna tough-guy Brit auteur — much Sisyphean task would remake Lina Wertmüller’s notorious 1974 film one famous women planet — Ritchie could made absolutely perfect film odds critics would torn apart anyway. Well, uh, Swept Away pretty much opposite perfect, imagine went. Much critical vitriol saved Madonna, clear, definitely great this, what’s striking limp slack Ritchie’s screenplay direction are. One would think married couple’s supposed passion project would sort oomphbehind it, sleepy movie Ritchie capable making. It’s actually worst film ever made. running time, though, sure feel way.
13. Revolver (2005)
Madonna Ritchie’s relationship lasted eight years produced two seemingly happy, lovely children, but, boy, movies made era duds. one isn’t worse Swept Away, may annoying movie, Ritchie attempted fuse tough-guy brashness first two films new pseudo-philosophical Kabbalah obsessions. result entirely incoherent crime thriller features gangsters prattling self ego soul occasionally wandering entirely different scene gangsters prattling thing. (This movie would totally get beaten Ritchie’s first two movies.) Revolver almost purposely impossible follow, it’s clear Ritchie even trying accomplish. seems realized extent misfire here, could argue spent rest career trying make many people possible forget ever existed. Mission accomplished?
12. King Arthur: Legend Sword (2017)
Coming time every even halfway recognizable piece intellectual property trying spun franchise, King Arthur: Legend Sword emblematic downsides approach. Charlie Hunnam plays Arthur, must rise glory Gladiator style evil uncle (Jude Law) wrests away control kingdom following dad’s killing. There’s patented Ritchie showmanship, mostly get boring ingredients cynically mixed together whenever studio smells new cinematic universe: Legend Sword gritty reboot that’s also dark origin story, we’re set sure-to-be sequel come. (Oh man, wait till get see Round Table part two!) doubt Warner Bros., previously hired Ritchie thing Sherlock Holmes, hoped lightning would strike twice. didn’t happen: film bombed, ending hope installments. depressingly, felt like Ritchie trying blockbuster existence; rarely seemed self-conscious approach.
Well, notion Ritchie Bond movie doesn’t sound like horrible idea, might Ritchie really energy one. Instead, oft-delayed, mostly hidden release feels drowsily DOA, Jason Statham sleepwalking smirking dull heist story never rouses slumber. Hugh Grant gives old college try Cockney accent villain, movie-star subplot never gets ground, perhaps movie star played Josh Hartnett everybody knows Josh Hartnett isn’t movie star. Ritchie’s dialogue oddly lazy here, trying set franchise making movie. (It doesn’t work.) Ever wonder possible Aubrey Plaza dull movie? Somehow, is.
10. Aladdin (2019)
commercial critical failure King Arthur movie, could understand Ritchie would go surefire hit follow-up. rationale little minimize bizarre learn he’d live-action Aladdin — watch actual film. proud member vast, underwhelming category bearably mediocre blockbusters, remake ’90s smash issue many Disney’s redos: mimics plotline original fails summon magic. Aladdin looks expensive doubt make, and, sure, Smith mildly endearing genie. rest cast members, barely register, Ritchie’s attempt pump spectacle comedy fall flat. man best characters bit scabrous, exact opposite want Disney film. (Not creative limitations mattered: thing made $1.1 billion.)
9. Sherlock Holmes: Game Shadows (2011)
Ritchie maximalist nature, part two franchise always tries top original. imagine Game Shadows like: It’s way bigger already supersize first installment, necessarily better. (And losing Rachel McAdams’s comic spark disappointment — she’s barely movie.) Jared Harris makes compelling Moriarty, Downey Law maintain bro-y chemistry, novelty Ritchie’s reimagining Sherlock Holmes can’t help feel bit stale second go-round. wouldn’t make another film four years, makes sense: churning two row, you’d probably need break recharge batteries.
People don’t usually turn Guy Ritchie movies profound insights human condition, Covenant crafted heartfelt drama American soldier (Jake Gyllenhaal) Afghan interpreter (Dar Salim) become friends, American learn government mistreats Afghan locals risked lives help U.S. occupation. It’s damning story worth telling, perhaps unsurprisingly, Covenant works best Ritchie falls back things well — namely, blowing stuff up. comes character development political commentary, movie unfortunately feels lot less confident. Putting name title doesn’t help matters either, suggesting self-seriousness pride authorship haven’t earned.
7. RocknRolla (2008)
last film Ritchie made married Madonna, feels like conscious effort Ritchie get back basics. case, that’s getting bunch British actors together British-gangster shit, movie hardly inspired — really feel like Ritchie actively reminding make movie flops Swept Away Revolver — helped terrific actors. want watch Tom Wilkinson British-gangster shit two hours? wouldn’t, right? line up: Gerard Butler, Mark Strong, Idris Elba, Toby Kebbell, Thandiwe Newton, and, course, Tom Hardy, playing man named “Handsome Bob.” ridiculous familiar, sort sense Ritchie stretching legs starting feel like again. RocknRolla plays like audition get make bigger movies again, one say: worked.
6. Wrath Man (2021)
watching trailers Jason Statham thriller — trailers essentially scream, “Aren’t ready get back theaters KICK ASS??!! — might think cheeky return-to-form Ritchie Statham, giddy over-the-top thrill ride. colorful gangsters colorful names, what’s perhaps surprising Wrath Man serious dark is. straight-up revenge saga, Statham father wreak havoc men killed teenage son, movie, jokey stage-setting intro, mostly eschews Ritchie’s usual quips one-liners. basically Ritchie’s version Heat, crime drama driven, tortured man won’t stop everyone wronged dead. Ritchie brings grim professionalism project well shifting timeline solid cast (including Andy Garcia, Holt McCallany, Scott Eastwood, Josh Hartnett, Jeffrey Donovan) makes movie feel little interesting really is. it’s solidly done efficient, even nothing much sticks ribs.
5. SherlockHolmes (2009)
Ritchie got hands him, predominant image Sherlock Holmes brainy, witty, slightly effete detective — certainly didn’t picture bare-knuckle bruiser. Sherlock Holmes changed that, casting Robert Downey Jr. Holmes whose mind quick fists. part film’s supercharged style, Ritchie switches slo-mo hear Holmes’s thought process he, say, strategizes best pummel opponent boxing ring. Downey ascending superstardom time thanks Iron Man, Sherlock Holmes landed perfect time, showing muscular physique sharp comic timing. (And Law fine foil Watson.) Pitched multiplex masses, Sherlock Holmes overblown earsplitting capture nuance Arthur Conan Doyle’s hero, told, it’s engaging enough feeling rather anonymous. fun see Ritchie, never operated budget level, pulling stops.
4. Gentlemen (2019)
Writing RocknRolla, Roger Ebert said, “British actors love playing gangsters much American actors love playing cowboys,” Gentlemen proof, especially tradition seems passed generation generation. Mark Strong Idris Elba Charlie Hunnam Henry Golding. (Americans Matthew McConaughey Jeremy Strong get play time, too.) movie feels much like Ritchie playing greatest hits, he’s comfortable time, less desperate prove himself. result almost … well, relaxed, exactly, certainly ease skin. Ritchie likely making movies like — like — he’s 94.
3. Man U.N.C.L.E. (2015)
years, big-screen remake 1960s spy series languished, Steven Soderbergh George Clooney briefly involved adaptation stepping aside. Ritchie came onboard delivered stylish, gorgeous-looking Cold War romp, pairing Henry Cavill Armie Hammer mismatched government operatives must work together stop underground criminal syndicate. involves joining forces daughter (Alicia Vikander) missing scientist, setting stage secret identities, cover stories, lots fabulous outfits. opened dog days August — usually dumping ground studios — Man U.N.C.L.E. presumed failure anyone even seen it. (Plus, offense, Ritchie isn’t quite Soderbergh’s level.) result, remake hailed quarters, regarded unfairly maligned celebrated breezy, sexy cast. (There’s also Elizabeth Debicki suave Nazi.) Neither disaster misunderstood masterpiece, Man U.N.C.L.E. finds Ritchie total blast throwback material, adrenalizing ’60s settings cutting-edge action spectacle. Ultimately, it’s little shallow disposable, won’t feel bad giving try lazy Sunday afternoon.
2. Lock, Stock, Two Smoking Barrels (1998)
Ritchie made directorial debut brash, badly behaved crime comedy, constantly compared Trainspotting films Quentin Tarantino. Funny thing that, though: “Danny Boyle interest whatsoever,” Ritchie said time, adding he’d never seen Reservoir Dogs, “[a]nd I’m past point I’m frightened [to] see fucking thing.” (He also didn’t much anything nice say another British crime film, Krays, declaring, “I thought [it] terrible. always felt made Krays, would made fucking good film.”) kind impolitic talk appropriate young hotshot determined take world — like Lock, Stock, Two Smoking Barrels thumbs nose delicate sensibilities, giving us bunch gangsters, crooks, lowlifes, card sharps trade potshots they’re meting violence. It’s heist film atmosphere attitude important — can’t say Ritchie didn’t eye talent. Vinnie Jones Statham got starts here, sense specific strain laddish British crime flick would attract worldwide audience make Ritchie household name.
1. Snatch (2000)
Snatch well reviewed came out, central criticism similar Barrels, even reusing similar plot points. Eventually, 20-plus years later, everyone would realize Ritchie’s crime movies basically riffs thing, slightly different variations song, helps one appreciate Snatch probably Platonic ideal Ritchie trying do: You’ve got colorful characters crazy names (“Mullet,” “Brick Top,” “Doug Head”) screaming bashing people’s heads getting impossible situations, even close intelligent enough find way out. Snatch funniest kinetic Ritchie movies least self-conscious: flooring it, good him. also features, gloriously, Brad Pitt’s boxer Mickey O’Neil, character Ritchie’s original script shows — Pitt couldn’t master London accent — mumbles gibberish destroying everyone path. Nothing O’Neil, “pikey,” makes lick sense, wow, seem like absolute gas play.
