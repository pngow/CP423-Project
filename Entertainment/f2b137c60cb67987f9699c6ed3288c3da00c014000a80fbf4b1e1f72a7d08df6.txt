“Would two prefer keep wildly theorizing, may continue story?” get impression question, asked Dr. Schrödinger visitors Lizzie Wiley, Mrs. Davis co-creator Damon Lindelof’s mind long time.
one hand, wild theorizing kept business. Large portions fanbases Watchmen,The Leftovers, especially Lost spent week week frantically guessing, even passionately arguing, would happen next. water coolers internet forums social media speculative articles on, well, websites like one, theorizing generates buzz maintains interest.
rate, Mrs. Davis wildly theorizing kind show. Lindelof co-creator showrunner Tara Hernandez have, respect least, truly committed bit. episode episode, storyline storyline, scene scene, occasionally line line, show constant deluge “everything thought knew wrong,” much even Lost.
it’s also much funnier Lost was. show, mysteries serious business. Mrs. Davis, contrast, whole thing one big metatextual tap dance atop fourth wall. isn’t show simply big twists turns, even show big twists turns — it’s show big twists turns inherently ridiculous. Look episode’s central conceit: Dr. Schrödinger recounts saga long-lost daughter Clara’s struggle win affection mother, Mathilde, destroying thing cares about, Holy Grail, Wiley Lizzie continuously interrupt spout new theories congratulate theories pan out, regardless many times revise previous theories reach right answer.
Look Wiley pats back “knowing” Schrödinger Clara’s father — even though he’d already “known” Father Ziegler, Grail cult acolyte turned rogue priest, father. Hey, got eventually, right? hadn’t happened actually bother saying he’d gotten Schroödinger revealed truth, well, that’s there’s Twitter desert island.
point this: see inclusion line writers cake eating too? way deliberately engineer story one hardly help wildly theorize, jokingly chastise viewers so. Yeah. also see self-aware least somewhat funny, like whole rest show? Also, yeah. one-liners sum whole project go, could lot worse.
fact line spoken one actors thing who’s given enough resources script come across like real person rather character story doesn’t hurt either. Particularly he’s wild-man-of-the-woods wig facial hair presented as, know, handsome bookish English science professor, Ben Chaplin convincingly normal, personable, likeable, maybe even relatable. say fake cowboy leading secret society bros dedicated destroying world’s powerful algorithm Jesus-fucking nun whose formative trauma involves getting shot crossbow part feud stage-magician parents four five reasons hunt either save destroy Holy Grail.
Okay, secret societies Holy Grail still factor basic deal. heart, he’s researcher whose colleagues bust chops whole “Schrödinger’s cat” thing, meets adult daughter didn’t know he’d woman loved spurned him, goes along scheme destroy Grail “whatever takes” part intellectual curiosity part, eventually, simply likes spending time kid. kind like guy.
said Mathilde (Katja Herbers), Clara’s nightmarish mother woman reluctantly initiates Sisters Coin, secret society (yep) devoted protection, preservation, — important — publicizing Grail. remote figure best times, becomes downright monster directing daughter epic British Knights commercial shown secret videotape last episode.
turns there’s bit art-imitating-life quality it, role Grail all, commercial. (Introducing series bloody fight sequence later reveal smoke mirrors bold choice one I’d necessarily made.) made single purpose: airing Super Bowl order fulfill mystical condition Grail must shown less one percent world’s population every year lest disaster strike.
Fed mother’s emotional brutality — including bogus claim she’s dying, made coax better lead performance Clara — daughter swaps Grail bogus one made vengeful Ziegler, also wants get back Mathilde getting treated like dirt years. whisks real one away Schödinger, whose identity location discovered via cache love letters he’d sent mom, rest history. Said history ends breaks one Grail’s real rules drinks it, causing head explode middle outdoor taco joint. paraphrase wise man said similar circumstances, chose … poorly.
two main characters story, best tell, comical, suspension-of-disbelief-threatening level. Take Mathilde, instance. big joke time, effort, money spent big British Knights Holy Grail commercial — notably forcing Hans/Ziegler spend years becoming priest infiltrating Vatican order embezzle money fund commercial find one secret European land holdings location film — never even got green light British Knights first. Never got anything writing, never face-to-face, never even bothered talking single person company, turned intern. whole thing spec talking kid working college credit whatever. It’s like something Rose Nylund would she’d entrusted artifact Indiana Jones series.
Schrödinger’s story makes little sense come right it. makes big deal Clara pitches drinking Grail last-ditch possibility destroying it. doesn’t want to, tries beat Rock/Paper/Scissors it, loses, drinks, dies. Boo hoo.
However! First all, you’d literal moron realize Clara lying tells 100 percent sure going throw Rock, causing throw Paper, she, course, beats throwing Scissors instead.
Second, Schrödinger tells whole story mouse drank Grail office died, cat ate mouse appears become immortal, leading believe incorporating body Grail victim grants immunity lethal powers, leading ensure Clara’s kidney gets donated, leading Lizzie Wiley receiving chunks kidney, leading potentially indestructible means Grail destroyed.
There’s one problem — actually, no, several problems. know mouse drank Grail? know that’s died? know cat mouse? would know test cat for, even needed testing first place? suspected drinking Grail lethal, even allow Clara entertain idea drinking it? didn’t know drinking Grail lethal head exploded, would gung ho donating litter create people immune Grail, since need immunity believe Grail poison way? would “microtoxins,” speculates Grail contains, cause human being’s head explode? matter, didn’t mouse’s head explode all? whole story bullshit, designed motivate Lizzie Wiley hunt whale Schrödinger eventually fed Grail reclaim it? whale even real? Grail even real?
episode makes worse spent full hour presenting Lizzie Wiley overeager, overtalkative, intent astute listeners, constantly poking holes story demanding answers many questions raises. Neither thought question Schrödinger’s story. easiest answer come “He’s lying.” couldn’t Lizzie Wiley come one too? They’re stars story, me!
said, probably I’ve enjoyed Mrs. Davis episode. shaggy-dog-joke quality Schrödinger’s long, wild, possibly cap story breezy engaging, especially Ziegler pops inject fun supervillain vibes thing. Chaplin excels father who’s become affectionate despite himself. Herbers makes Mathilde insufferable piece shit, exactly be. particularly liked failure commercial doesn’t slow emotional abuse daughter one bit; within two minutes exposed humiliated front entire order, fires Clara sucking acting, problem commercial, Mathilde complete idiot. extends selection British Knights, brands, footwear future, maybe central joke whole storyline.
There’s also brief interlude Jesus, reveals occasionally gets beaten visitors celestial felafel restaurant. What’s that, wonder? guessed it: Time start wildly theorizing!
