point past 30 years amused high jinks Black sitcom, chances Larry Wilmore something it. Raised tumultuous household East L.A. suburb Pomona, high-school athlete turned theater geek touring Southland stand-up comedian almost decade joined writers’ room new series called Living Color. show became cultural cornerstone early 1990s, launching careers Jim Carrey Jamie Foxx giving Wilmore role model, showrunner Keenen Ivory Wayans, would become career mission: putting Black creators control Black TV. beginning golden age Black sitcom, Wilmore, along younger brother fellow comedy writer, Marc, played key roles unfolded.
Younger audiences probably familiar Wilmore, 60, hosting gig short-lived satirical news program Nightly Show — racially pointed spinoff Daily Show Jon Stewart, Wilmore played senior (and only) Black correspondent — glowing praise since received mentees Issa Rae,Robin Thede, Quinta Brunson. earned stripes writer, creator, producer beloved comedies like Fresh Prince Bel-Air (“a mess”), PJs (“One best shows time,” Chris Rock told him), maybe notably Bernie Mac Show. 2002 Emmy win last made history: Wilmore first Black TV writer triumph comedy category — “mole” Fox Television uncover plot oust Wilmore shortly after. (It successful.) morning daughter’s Barnard graduation May, met Wilmore — genial, bespectacled, unexpectedly fiery — coffee, spent several hours reminiscing, laughing, shaking head past three decades comedy TV.
always performer? Marc used go bed night trying make laugh. backdrop could hear parents arguing, ’cause going divorce; remember hearing vase crash wall like, “Oh.” Meanwhile, good characters, would imitate people around us. neighbors next door; called Uncle Henry wife B.B., Texas. Henry would give advice like, “Larry, spare.” I’m like, “What mean?” says, “One girl leave, going do? got nothing.” We’re 9 years old, he’s telling us need side piece.
Pomona like growing up? Black middle-class place parents first moved there. father probation officer. jobs could get could get real professional jobs, know? saw lot people civil-service jobs.
You’ve told story formative experience racism involving police. hearing cops next door, rushed sister’s room looked window. sounded like banging door, remember cop said, “Freeze, nigger, dead!” in, “You’re going die seconds, authority impunity.” brother used talk time, talked jokes, like kid would do, realizing words really meant. wasn’t older like, Man, weight words together sums many things see today.
experience complicate understanding dad work? different experience law enforcement him. wasn’t anti-police; able compartmentalize bad behavior many Blacks worked law enforcement, including friends probation department. I’m saying looking back. remember dad getting pulled couple times, would open wallet, soon badge shown, nicest people world. me, power star like magic trick. I’ve always viewed cop issue much terms race terms power dynamics. Black people people seduced drunk power much white people.
dad became doctor later. wrong person become doctor — like, zero bedside manner. felt Rodney King wasn’t beaten hard enough.
stand-up Comic Strip Live 1990, introduced wanting “to like father: cold insensitive.” There’s clearly truth there. think job brought him? That’s hilarious. No, that’s is. mom overly emotional. dad — plane could crash house next door reaction would be, “Hm. Evidently man meant fly.”
Obviously dark also funny. parents funny people? Oh, completely, control it. funny characters. Growing I’m comedy.
recognized later life mom nervous breakdown kid. relate world probably starts there. You’ve seen mom suffer; don’t want see others. sisters run away several times — rebellion everything. father worked juvenile home, sisters went juvie. lowest point, including money-wise. I’m oldest home basically feeling like got take care stuff.

hardship turn career comedy? last couple years high school trying find escapes, escaped sports theater. academic career pretty much went toilet. lucky came sports, really good, lived sports neighborhood, too: Billy Duffy, Greg Ballard, Cornell Webster. little corner neighborhood, let alone Pomona back then. young age, could see took elite athlete, knew — couldn’t delude yourself. like, I’m going devote theater see happens.
remember first time performing stand-up? thought ready audition Comedy Store. I’d never done stand-up — maybe high-school talent show — lied age. think might 16 17. went onstage, memorized little routine old comedy record, impressions. got big laughs. don’t know people knew doing, called back said, “That great. want come back showcase owner.” two weeks later, remember getting sick dog. Everything went right first time went horribly wrong second. audience didn’t laugh bit. And, course, owner club knows I’m someone else’s routine — didn’t think time. People who, first time, like, “Oh, you’re good!” — one wants look now. cold stand-up is. There’s death you. It’s worst feeling world. took three four years try stand-up that.
knew to. really started it, six months, working regularly places, headlining clubs two years. writing jokes every day, put control career rather behest whims business. say it’s important us control futures, fate, talk gets control narrative something — that’s stand-up taught me. way could work. wasn’t Denzel.
first TV-writing gig, 1990–91, late-night show hosted Rick Dees called Night. got job, 28, 29 maybe, seasoned stand-up comic. knew was, knew could funny. job lasted six months, wrote leisure. used write jokes comedians, really favor. making transition time kind abandoned stand-up route. couldn’t get auditions things right me, didn’t see — wasn’t Def Jam type comic. ghetto, type thing. God forbid smart Black comic talk politics. That’s reserved white people, wasn’t case growing up. Dick Gregory smart. Redd Foxx called “party records.” Bill Cosby told clean stories. Godfrey Cambridge like hipster, talked culture race. could lane. late 1980s early 1990s, Hollywood pushed us one lane. That’s decided needed write produce create space myself.
You’ve said initially indebted Jewish humor Black humor. dad took us see Marx Brothers, going revival early 1970s, big screen. Animal Crackers showing, like, “Oh God, funniest thing I’ve ever seen.” also old radio, 8-tracks old Jack Benny show, brother used listen them. Redd Foxx Richard Pryor — weren’t rhythms head age. became content thing later rhythm thing.
second TV-writing job Living Color. biggest thing television time really culture changer. way, wasn’t “urban” enough audition show, good enough write it, interesting. see Black comics different rhythms now, like Jerrod Carmichael. Now, it’s big deal, couldn’t exist back then. me, Living Color best kind gig could — there’s lot conceptual stuff going there, funny observations, many layers it.
I’ve read, sounded like work hours — think quote “insane, possibly illegal.” Thousand percent true. worst times, worst times.
day look like? Often I’d till three morning, working weekends home, come pitches. People got fired time. called Keenen “Murphy Brown” new assistant every week. seemed like, Oh, didn’t make oatmeal right week? They’re getting fired. bad pitch, Keenen would mime putting bullets gun chamber, we’d go, “Uh-oh, it’s chamber!” he’d knock out, like, Oh shit, knowing going get fired whatever. lot fun.
It’s legendary Black cultural moment, looking credits, lot white writers, maybe even majority. That’s Hollywood was.
process assembling room? Keenen. let tell you, didn’t matter. Many white writers formidable. Les Firestein, one brilliant comic minds; stuff pitched, dying laughing. completely inappropriate. Matt Wickline started Letterman andJohn Bowman started SNL, think Matt originally came Homey D. Clown. really didn’t matter. Black writers newbies, weren’t lot us business.
balance influence ends onscreen? feel point like tension? Zero. didn’t even think then. cultural fences terms of, “Well, can’t write you’re white.” Nope. fair game. really got bring funny. didn’t matter were. Keenen extremely democratic terms that.
still feel way? I’ve always felt way. mean, sure, there’s nuanced conversation telling stories, different thing. keep mind Keenen head show. controlling narrative. little worker bees giving honey. who’s giving honey little different who’s controlling hive. powerful time — Keenen show wanted do, couldn’t it, left.
saw talk-show interview shortly L.A. riots said pitched sketch restaurant South Central called “Reginald Denny’s.” remember “Grand Slam” breakfast. kind pride writing jokes poor taste. Sammy Davis Jr. died, wrote sketch called “Weekend Sammy’s” like Weekend Bernie’s.
Oh God. Davis’s widow, Altovise, couldn’t pay taxes, pretend Sammy still alive. She’s taking around like, “Hey, man!” that. hilarious, felt little disrespectful. ended Ghost parody instead, Whoopi Goldberg character invoked Sammy, turned sweet sketch. remember didn’t make ones did. wrote one called “Compton Leap” — play Quantum Leap — brother would jump people inopportune moment. jumped body Rodney King right he’s pulled over. There’s nothing redeeming sketch. that’s mean: inappropriate, better. writers tried out-inappropriate other.
told Bill Simmons show people used go comedy order shocked. think ideal? primary purpose comedy get laughs. serves well, lot purposes become secondary tertiary. audience sits don’t laugh, feel like comedian failed comedy failed job. different types comedy serve different purposes. Maybe purpose say things line. comes people’s tastes, often agree don’t agree with, including political standpoint, fits one types, find funny.
apply too? respond comedy really clashes with, say, political sensibilities? don’t mind. don’t need agreement order see value something.
I’m thinking Dave Chappelle jokes transgender people, particularly since past you’ve described LGBTQ+ community’s fight “one civil-rights issues time.” Chappelle interesting. don’t know right term is, think he’s revealing onstage. He’s granted certain permission, he’s speaking audience way nobody else quite does. That’s touchy subject, though. You’re going see jokes area. biggest reason time there’s group really feeling attacked, you’ve got careful. would really good take something put jokes.
ever make professional judgments based content comedy like that? I’m thinking like — dare say that! I’ll never work person! don’t conversations myself. I’ve never opportunity work Dave Chappelle. would silly say, “Well, I’m going work Dave Chappelle.” Nobody asked to. someone asked me, would think consider it.
Living Color, went traditional sitcom writing. read quote Felicia D. Henderson, worked Fresh Prince Bel-Air, said bulk job answering white writers’ questions whether scene story line felt true real Black person would do. remember it? year mess. Jeff Pollack equipped running show. didn’t know doing. Felicia quit quit couldn’t believe brave enough quit. didn’t finish sixth season. terrible. remember going Smith, said, “It’s nothing you, man” — Men Black everything — like, “You’re blow up, can’t work boy, man. got bounce here.” nice it.
writers Fresh Prince — don’t remember names, thank God — type superiority thing. I’m sure Felicia felt that, too. really disregarded. second year Sister, Sister,there guys running little bit bullshit. two shows felt that. determined Keenen doing: No, motherfuckers. I’m going determine tone thing.

word authenticity gets used lot argue Black storytellers TV. right standard? use different frame authenticity, call anyone’s experience. me, it’s gets say see. Whose gaze this? white gaze? Black gaze? male gaze? female gaze? television, Blackness seen white gaze. Good Times could call authentic, it’s white-gaze authentic. Even though idea came Black writer, God bless Norman Lear, that’s still white man.
Us controlling narrative different white executives giving check mark. nobody saying, “Keenen, that’s Black. can’t that.” revolutionary act. Blacks decision-making process get say, “Yeah, kind story. That’s fine.” even white people positions saying Black creators, “You tell story. don’t say that.” That’s different now, too, opposed to, “No, it’s got type thing.”
kind gatekeeping. Here’s expressed: Black writers white shows. one days Saladin Patterson, got job Frasier. huge time. Never happened. would Television Critics Association things Bernie Mac, people kept asking, “Larry, many Black writers show?” said, “Motherfucker, ask white shows many Black writers have! I’m one Black writers. fuck asking?” would get upset it. Like, ask Friends, Frasier, shows. I’ve got shows combined. would shut that.
remember conversation friend Janine Sherman Barrois, who’s showrunner. working Jamie Foxx’s show time. Janine like, “Larry, come there’s Black Seinfeld?” Meaning show considered Black smart. said, “Janine, haven’t written yet.” go, “Wait, oh, fuck, neither I.” really motivated write PJs Eddie Murphy, make something smart TV culturally important time. It’s niggas funny, know? It’s smart too, niggas. Use word, white people: smart. Say it.
PJs pretty different remember public narrative kid. One early detractors, Spike Lee, said showed “no love Black people.” love prerequisite making good Black TV? disagree premise. PJs satire. we’re shining light social situations, social interactions. Whether it’s something agree disagree with, is. mean, crackhead show.
You’ve said “seminal.” actually TV trope. Andy Griffith town drunk; Taxi town drug addict. crackhead. also jokes Calvin said, “Juicy, man, hope never grow old.” Juicy goes, “Well, statistics favor.” satire. It’s supposed love letter. PJs smart.
Black creatives struggled long time debate whether presenting image going somehow used us. don’t strategize bad actors. dramatize situations conflict I’m storyteller. Now, conscience responsibility, obviously point view hang Black people dry. That’s do. also don’t precious tell story; honest time.
think boundary-pushing show? I’ve created? Oh 1,000 percent. Absolutely. None that’s come close. There’s lot imperfection PJs, works satire intended be.
You’ve spoken watching lot French New Wave films inspiration Bernie Mac Show. Sure, pilot. also watching reality television, like PBS show The1900 House, put cameras house England people live like 1900. fascinating. confessional camera could tell us day. thought, sitcom kind form? looked like kind spying family. saw Bernie Original Kings Comedy taking care sister’s kids, thought, That’s nice emotional thing. pitched him, loved it.
Emmy Award pilot. hard write first. you’re writing pilots, sell it, you’re supposed turn outline, studio gives notes write script. never turned outline knew different, couldn’t quite get it. wrote three pages every day like four weeks. scared death. I’m like, pitch stupid thing?
tapes Real World, remember playing looking act break, there’s question something come back get answer. Real World didn’t that. would go commercial. I’m like, What’s going on? They’re manipulation thing. want watch this? realized, Well, maybe I’m interested character want see them. turned light switch on: Okay, don’t manipulation. could character’s ride. still couldn’t get past three pages. Four half weeks go haven’t communicated studio all. disaster. One day, get page four, go, Oh! clicked. poured next 36 hours. script ended winning Emmy year half later. watch it, there’s really plot. see go journey. He’s confident beginning, confidence gets weaker there’s acceptance: guess things going different.
also fired show. seemed like network got while, abandoned it. Trust me, no, not. bathroom one day, head Fox time, Sandy Grushow, told mole, “Well, guess can’t fire now.” comment. Not, “Oh, we’re really proud Larry.”
mole? can’t say. Even years.
He’s Deep Throat. Exactly. intercepted lot emails stuff me, too. got one said needed separate Bernie. close. Unfortunately, lost Bernie’s ear demons whatever, don’t blame Bernie that. always fight them. type storytelling everybody now. back then, weren’t single-camera shows.
episode called “Hot, Hot, Hot.” execs go, “Well, happens episode?” go, “It’s hot.” They’re like, “Yeah, happens?” go, “Um, it’s hot.” made mad; didn’t understand. I’m like, “Bernie’s got take care kids, it’s hot; don’t know tell you.” really simple, turned one popular episodes.
That’s one things kids, know. Yes, absolutely right. think it. go, Oh, there’s three acts.
you’re making show that’s successful, that’s critically acclaimed — Didn’t matter. gets benefit doubt time? Black writers. considered incompetent, like didn’t know doing. Meanwhile, Emmy, two TCA Awards, Humanitas, Peabody Award, Golden Globe nominee, Image Award. Every award could possibly name meant nothing.
don’t seem like you’re disagreeable person. turn asshole. no, I’m monster. I’m trying make good show. Grushow treated lot people horribly time. wasn’t alone that.
going personal stuff, too. marriage breaking apart time. It’s tough. really love do, stick there. career could over. small children, too. like, “I got work. kids got go school.”
actor consulting producer Office. started writing producing back day create space myself. Office led back performing. table read “Diversity Day” episode, got lot laughs. Ken Kwapis, also directed Bernie Mac pilot, like, “Larry, this.”
people don’t remember American version Office highly regarded. went England seminar Bernie Mac Show. Ash Atalla, one producers English Office, there. said, “Do favor: Make sure never take America ruin it.” go, “I’ll tell — does, I’ll never work something like that.” Smash-cut working it, I’m motherfucker.
came Daily Show, different format altogether. time, already thinking lot creating show star going back stand-up roots talk-show thing. I’d written script called “Fat Man, Skinny Wife,” behind-the-scenes look sitcom Black-sitcom point view. course, little know I’m competing instant classic like Tina Fey’s 30 Rock, Aaron Sorkin’s Studio 60 Sunset Strip, that’s TV works sometimes.
thought, Well, can’t talk show right now. haven’t done stand-up while, reestablish connection audience. thought maybe Daily Show, could start reestablishing personality.
show diverse showed up. Exactly. wasn’t writer Daily Show. would come in, they’d idea, would still hash Jon. pieces really elevated discussions us deconstructing them.
like beginning? first piece, correspondent. head? Stephen Colbert correspondent. can’t impression him. You’ve got find self. didn’t know yet. co-wrote piece people there. trying refine it. rehearsal, supposed two different pieces. going show one night another one later. went horribly rehearsal. mean, terribly. don’t think got one laugh. kind forced.
remembered feeling first stand-up, people making eye contact me. It’s like don’t name one animals may eat later don’t want get close it: don’t think he’s going back. performer first foremost, that’s worst feeling world. somebody came said, “Okay, Larry, here’s we’re going do.” I’m fearing worst, like, one shot Daily Show I’m going ruin it. cut first piece. Jon says, “Hey, man, come here. Let’s put second one words. It’s little writer-y.” we’re bantering back forth rather formal process writing script. much free.
going TV night front audience. Jon looks says, “Hey, man, fucking give America.” best advice could given me. stand-up instincts took over. got huge laughs, I’m like, right. I’m now. could feel team wondering, Well, guy come from? wasn’t guy rehearsal. Completely opposite Comedy Store experience. Failure first, wild success after.
felt like people taking Daily Show’s political comedy seriously guidepost interpret actual political world. New York Times piece headlined “Is Jon Stewart Trusted Man America?” gave much credit.
much think courted even encouraged that? Probably some. People wanted actual activism. people say, “Phone Jon Stewart — said something, maybe Trump wouldn’t elected,” I’m like, No, that’s works. looking comedians important decisions world? problem Jon show. It’s great. need North Star.
reconcile fact Trump, open misgivings person president, would also good content hoping create long-term Nightly Show? Les Moonves got trouble saying something like that. It’s always conflict. used say, “As soon racism’s gone, we’re done here!” It’s part bargain type humor.
get tense ugly Comedy Central? said certain point wouldn’t even talk guys later felt sense Schadenfreude network couldn’t put together another late-night success. don’t mind salty cancellation. tough things. People remember slot Stephen Colbert had, passionate, loyal audience. put show pedestal. show was, think, ingested lot crowd show replaced Stephen’s show. judged partly standpoint. network’s point view, was, “Here numbers Stephen leaving” — got there, leaving — “How come numbers aren’t here?” uphill climb. knew beginning way could compete Stephen did. thing.
takes find show. Even Jon Stewart — took Daily Show Craig Kilborn — people weren’t pleased first, took turn show. thought made show special conversation America said wanted have. I’m like, right, motherfuckers. We’re going it. Comedy Central wanted us games things like that. think point view they’re trying fix show. never approached like, “Is show expression Larry Wilmore’s voice?”
time canceled, weren’t interested us. hadn’t talked us months. pretty much finding show point. think people really appreciated it. Many fans felt voice wilderness covering issues others weren’t covering. well oiled handle situation came news. could comedy; could discussion. built both, could keep real format. entertaining.
feel like Trevor Noah’s iteration Daily Show network’s attempt find middle point show Jon’s show? Tell really think, Zak.
I’m interested think. trying say exactly? saying didn’t want two Black hosts? saying didn’t want Black Black? you’re saying?
I’m saying that; I’m asking. Oh, don’t know. mean, think call ask them. think it’s good question. Although would like record saying never even considered that, want thank bringing point up.
much anticipate? didn’t know expect it’s tough room. I’m comedian, knew hole. Believe me. started made joke first Joe Biden, got kind “Ooh” everybody really loved Joe then. I’m like, Ugh. said thing Wolf Blitzer. meant sarcastic, came straight fact. like, “Why picking Wolf Blitzer?” part like, Look — whatever, motherfuckers.
done caring knew. I’m like, Well, I’m going barrel jokes whether laugh not. see looks like I’m really enjoying it, mind, rather thing it’s like, Oh, didn’t think funny? fight them, thing mind acted like really laughing really enjoying it.
Washington Post afterward, talked skipping jokes intended make, one Jada Pinkett Smith — thanking Jada boycotting like Oscars year. know something rest us didn’t? could’ve gotten slapped! That’s hilarious. would’ve guessed that?
anyone wouldn’t make joke might rush onstage slap face? Absolutely not. Nobody’s off-limits.
decide you’re going mentor? don’t playbook. probably say “no” say “yes.” People worked know take process, sometimes feel like therapy. remember working someone — I’m going say we’re something right — brought idea, wasn’t bad, kind surface-y. knew more. started asking questions life.
became thing came me. wasn’t public that. started talking it, started investigating more, said, “Let tell show need do.” end that, completely different thing. laughed while. somebody’s saying something tell it’s authentic, push toward authentic conversation. try respectful, too. people aren’t it, it’s amazing many people are. lot writers, don’t know put guards first. Maybe they’re trying impress you. throw away, get person is. sometimes won’t even tell show; I’ll ask life what’s going them. I’m maybe interested person they’re bringing, like, “That point view needs TV could show.”
good boss, think people who’ve worked would agree answer? reputation good boss. Whether I’m effective boss time — knows? try fair. hire people already believing do, don’t demand it. expect it, different. job isn’t pump best, think you’re best already.
want talk little younger brother, Marc, also became TV writer died COVID last year. dynamic like? love brother tremendously. Miss lot. started stand-up, Marc started year later surprised me. said, “Oh, want stand-up?” like, “If couldn’t well, wasn’t going it.” wanted see would sink swim. able swim, gave confidence it.
got way, unfortunately. emotional person. hard himself. Low self-esteem, big ego, high IQ terms abilities. low IQ terms worth that. Crazy. person many gifts thought wasn’t good also ego someone good.
Writers face impostor syndrome, took harder have, always burden. hated that. Marc inventive. funny. different skill sets. good impressionist. could voices different people. Marc could faces. could become somebody. funniest thing watch contort face.
Mid-’80s: Larry Marc mother’s house. Photo: Courtesy Wilmore
think like stemmed household dynamics kids? I’m convinced people are. part life’s journey get proper relationship it. Marc always like that. always got angry faster. me, always compartmentalize, even look back childhood. things brain won’t allow remember. Marc internalized lot that.
ended working together early on. Living Color. Purely accident. think Marc felt shadow sometimes, like Larry’s brother. would sting him. didn’t know sometimes people call Marc. used write jokes George Wallace, sometimes 50 bucks joke. walked Laugh Factory one night, Wallace there, said, “Hey, forgot pay joke. I’m giving $50,” thinking I’m Marc. I’m like, “I’m letting guy give money. I’m going say anything.” I’ve known George years. dare think Marc? George calls me, trying get money back trying give Marc. I’m like, “George, pay $50, keeping that.”
used joke years.
