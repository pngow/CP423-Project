events Evil Dead II, cursed book sucks Ash chain saw time vortex, sending back age King Arthur. Wielding double-barred shotgun Excalibur, Ash serves camp (few forget calling witch “she-bitch”) cheesiness quest return home. evil dead spirit far mischievous time, Army Darkness trades comparatively modest bloodletting beheadings first films even ridiculous sights like devilish body double, bumbling skeleton warriors, naughty books bite back. It’s clear Raimi enjoyed excesses Hollywood budget ($11 million compared $3.5 million Evil Dead II), medieval battle scenes special effects delivered laudable high quality.

Know director Lee Cronin wanted keep original black humor alive well — especially unfunny 2013 film. beheaded doll named “Staph-anie” stuck stick becomes lifesaving scepter, endless horror-movie references (such elevator emptying Olympic-size swimming pool blood) cheekily enliven story’s macabre turns. end, Evil Dead Rise shows there’s still vitality found Book Dead’s many skin-bound pages.
3. Ash vs. Evil Dead (2015–2018)
Ash took well-earned time Army Darkness picked boomstick back 2015 Starz TV series Ash vs. Evil Dead.

1. Evil Dead II (1987)
