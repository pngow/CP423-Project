reshot ending Adrian Lyne’s 1987 Fatal Attraction one successful blunders Hollywood history.
Sure, turning Glenn Close’s scorned Alex Forrest nearly unkillable slasher villain undermined anything thematically interesting character movie. also produced rousing climax left bloodthirsty audiences cheering helped make Fatal Attraction blockbuster.
“There’s one way something end,” Alex (Lizzy Caplan) asserts eighth final episode Paramount+’s Fatal Attraction. “There’s one decision make. going get ending?”
Unfortunately, certitude, new ending offers improvement Lyne’s ruthlessly efficient original bloated journey get rarely satisfying. Despite several exceptional performances, Fatal Attraction can’t find desired middle ground voyeuristic thrills psychological nuance, despite many enticing options, can’t plant flag important piece zeitgeist.
Oh, bunnies harmed production Fatal Attraction, I’ll leave interpret positive negative.
Series developers Alexandra Cunningham Kevin J. Hynes moved things Los Angeles (or cheap soundstages, Los Angeles establishing shots) bifurcated narrative.
present day, Dan Gallagher (Joshua Jackson) paroled serving 15 years killing Alex Forrest. professional fortunes, family hair destroyed incarceration, Dan tries reconnect daughter Ellen (Alyssa Jirrels), teaming investigator buddy Mike (Toby Huss) clear name murder insists didn’t commit.
Back 2008-ish, see Dan approaching 40th birthday man seemingly everything. He’s fast-riser district attorney’s office judgeship possibly immediate future. beautiful endlessly patient wife Amanda Peet’s Beth. Then, rare moment, meets Alex, vague things city’s victim services department. flirt shared pet peeves meatballs margaritas, soon they’re bopping studio apartment’s kitchen island. Dan, it’s lapse judgment. Alex, it’s break pervasive isolation feels new city. Things soon get obsessive and, inevitably, deadly.
News remake greeted predictably banal gnashing teeth the, “Oh gee, bet they’re going make Dan bad guy he’s successful white man turn Alex victim!” vein. easily dismissible two counts. first go back watch original movie, Michael Douglas’ Dan total putz. Eventually Alex over-escalates it’s longer Dan deserves, long time? He’s dummy.
simply, though, new Fatal Attraction get Dan Gallagher. Yes, he’s depicted paragon white privilege, nepobaby handed job and, even stumbles, never experienced consequence life. accept claim didn’t kill Alex, one consequence end facing disproportionate. He’s dummy, he’s villain.
Fatal Attraction fully redeem Alex. Caplan’s capable hands, she’s sympathetic character. series wants sensitive empathetic depiction clearly recognizable mental illness, escalation remains disproportionate. She’s victim narrative, series, she’s still villain.
sounds like Fatal Attraction wants ways, absolutely does. It’s full nods movie range tiny (Alex likes black leather, quite movie’s black leather trenchcoat) blatant (Alex really doesn’t like ignored) silly (I said rabbits harmed, darned didn’t shoehorn rabbits show anyway), time thinks it’s superior movie’s non-stop adrenaline rush.
means certain point, series stops trying shocking thrilling sexy — kitchen bopping limited single episode limited eroticism well — instead tries flimsy intellectual work around skeleton story. There’s full trial, complete many logical gaffes could giggle. There’s episode dedicated primarily Alex’s backstory, don’t want spoil revelations, I’ll hint problem predictably rhymes “schmaddy schmissues.” And, worst all, Ellen psychology student spends one episode another listening class lectures Jung invariably exactly parallel we’ve learning Dan Alex. One character even say out-loud similarities “that shadow stuff” Ellen studying stuff life.
new material, Fatal Attraction precious little say modern context. Dan facing consequences isn’t, finally, commentary cancel/consequence culture. Making workplace affair doesn’t, finally, give #MeToo shadings Dan/Alex dynamic. Mike whole monologue flaws legal system criminal rehabilitation process, don’t think that’s Fatal Attraction either. although it’s mentioned 2023, “murder brand” fascinates people, there’s little connection insatiable true crime appetites — odd given Cunningham created perceptive Dirty John anthology.
isn’t say aren’t positives fleshing narrative.
Caplan combustible delight showy role earned Close one Oscar nominations. She’s scary, never way becomes cartoonish, infuses character potent loneliness.
Peet, good second Dirty John seasons, especially Jirrels good capturing wreckage reconstruction life Dan tore pieces. actually always watched movie pondering impact trauma little Ellen. Would answer wasn’t mostly gravitation toward Wikipedia summaries Jungian archetypes.
Best Huss, funnier yet authentic anything around glorified “best friend” role elevates something fully watchable. 2023 scenes Huss’ Mike newly released Dan become Odd Couple-style roomies Jackson’s best moments well. Otherwise, kept wondering hair makeup team mean why, spending years layered exploration infidelity (Showtime’s Affair), actor wanted force comparisons here.
Circling back around endings, without specifically spoiling anything, I’ll say new Paramount+ Fatal Attraction two endings: one dumb anticlimactic, ridiculous silly. could work justify first ending emotional terms second pop psychology terms. still wouldn’t enough make show worthwhile.
