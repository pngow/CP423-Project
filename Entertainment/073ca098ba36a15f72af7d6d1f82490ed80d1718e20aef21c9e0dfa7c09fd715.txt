Spoilers follow first season Diplomat, debuted April 20 Netflix.
Watch out, Prime Video, Netflix coming deep-state mantle. Sarandos-land steadily expanding thematic space Amazon, home dad TV like Jack Ryan, Terminal List, upcoming Citadel, series center CIA, Navy SEALs, American-aligned ideologies. Netflix’s contributions genre include Recruit, CIA lawyer thrown field; Night Agent, FBI desk jockey thrown field; latest release, Diplomat, international political operative thrown — guessed — field, time British ambassador’s palace worlds away war zones she’s used to.
Creator showrunner Debora Cahn put time West Wing Homeland, Diplomat also features tons wonky walking gabbing, “complicated” female protagonist whose romantic relationships tied work life, frankly exhausting amount imperialism-excusing neoliberalism. many times one series use Afghan women props understanding sad powerful, wealthy white protagonist is? embarrassing amount! act American decision-makers initiated invasion Iraq wracked guilt ever since? Also embarrassing amount! Diplomat full othering historical revisionism, irritating enough position characters working behalf American empire tormented burden loyal sacrifice. coupled moments Keri Russell’s Kate simply irresistible colleagues childish ways positioned empowerment, Diplomat becomes superficial slog self-important “herstory.” None tropes new series U.S. government’s international dealings post-9/11, yet Diplomat makes particularly exhausting. four things Diplomat never want see TV again.
1.
Iran scapegoat
admit bias here: Iranian American, it’s pretty jarring watch characters TheDiplomat, starts suggesting Iran attacked British aircraft carrier, casually drop declarative statements country’s antisemitism military violent even Syrian president Bashar al-Assad (a man used chemical weapons people), refuse apologize death Iranian ambassador (which, point story, Brits Americans might caused) Iran’s citizens “hardly nuns.” isn’t painting broad brush; it’s drowning canvas decades axis-of-evil talking points. Kate presented “Iran expert,” series never explains unique credentials drew study country (she speaks three words Farsi days narrative time). Without grounding, entire first half season feels like excuse Diplomat deliver propagandist commentary — right it’s revealed Iran wasn’t responsible attack U.K. all.
Diplomat grasps balance portraying Kate stunned two members Iranian family murdered outside British mosque, perpetrator inspired Prime Minister Nicol Trowbridge’s (Rory Kinnear) inflammatory statements Iran. Kate’s shocked response hate crime, it’s first time she’s ever heard ethnically religiously motivated violence, unintentionally hilarious, since Islamophobic hate crimes hovered thousands U.K. since 2017 surged 28 percent 2021 2022. Kate is, again, supposed knowledgeable political operator; may newbie side pond, guess what? Islamophobia exists U.S. too! series often falls back “Kate feels bad” storytelling device, loses efficacy makes look uninformed naïve impact (or lack thereof) attempts diplomacy.
Plus, Diplomat basically copies entire plot Terminal List. series, Chris Pratt’s protagonist, James Reece — believes ambush fellow Navy SEALs murder family organized Iran — decides hunt kill responsible, realizes deceived ally knew Reece’s time stationed Syria means would accept Iranians villains. Diplomat isn’t even going creative xenophobia, what’s point?
2.
Using brown people’s pain character development others
Basically every American-made movie TV series wars Afghanistan Iraq uses framing “we’re traumatized forced kill innocent men, women, children,” Causeway Card Counter Punisher second season True Detective. approach generally avoids portraying brown people injured, displaced, tortured, killed onscreen characters, effectively become anonymous victims service deepening developing people invaded countries.
Diplomat presents Kate colleagues CIA uniformly defensive regarding wars, misled believing “Iraqi weapons mass destruction” lie (which millions protesters around world objected time) failing get Afghan allies country U.S. withdrew — awful enough stopped working American government. believed America, what’s wrong that? (This Cahn’s time West Wing feels obvious.)
Maybe contrition would feel genuine Diplomat made space story — even one — millions Middle Eastern people affected post-9/11 wars. one scene, Kate eats pastries bed underwear, lamenting missing calls one Afghan women worked alongside who’s stuck Taliban rule. makes feel “like everyone else” “dumped … every democracy-oriented Afghan throughout time.” Uh, maybe start actually calling back woman abandoned war-torn country? Instead, U.K.’s foreign secretary Kate’s new love interest, Austin Dennison (David Gyasi), tells Kate she’s “a decent person time decency lost hold public imagination.”
Diplomat feels like it’s trying convince us Kate’s moral superiority saddling allies dialogue dumps regrets, never provides full context regrets. American president says, “Fifty thousand British soldiers marched Baghdad asked to, chased era defined profound lack interest anybody ourselves,” he’s erasing drastic increase American drone warfare Middle East recent years, including hundreds civilians killed, well country’s involvement Syrian civil war. Diplomat’s inability see Middle East anything place attack save mimicry approach claims critiquing, amount passionate speech-ifying change hypocrisy.

girlbossery
Speaking leaning in: stop female protagonists really great one thing terrible everything else? Kate hyped intelligent, no-bullshit reader people rooms. She’s regular ambassador got job donated money president’s campaign; she’s cool, savvy political operator really deserves gig (because bunch unexplained stuff Middle East). Kate intent saving world time manners (biting directly gigantic quiche stolen country estate’s kitchen), clothes (screaming underling, “Pants, fucking dresses!”), office niceties (“This generation women apologize everything. Gloria Steinem must rolling grave.”). colleagues talk crushes her, because, finally, woman telling like — somehow, even ignorance Steinem big-F Feminist.
tell Diplomat wants moments GIF’d, like fed-up Kate rejects meddling husband, Hal (Rufus Sewell), pointed “Sweetheart, it’s fucking classified,” exchange feels straight mouth Strong Female Character(TM). Must women positions power infuriatingly neurotic can’t control around attractive peers, refuse brush hair, mock women’s media? (“What advice little girls?” scoffs pitched idea Vogue profile.) course sexism exists highest echelons power, course sucks Kate deal part job. boorishness sloppiness don’t feel like realism — feel like stuff we’re supposed find charming Woman Politician it.
4.
Rory Kinnear bad guy
Perhaps Rory Kinnear lovely person real life, TV film? guy’s characters worst. Kinnear’s great actor, every time shows onscreen get stomachache. soon sexist, xenophobic, arrogant prime minister starts popping war Iran Russia, it’s clear Trowbridge doesn’t exactly country’s best interests heart. little tell Kinnear’s typecasting makes season’s double-cliffhanger ending — Kate figures Trowbridge secretly attacked aircraft carrier draw U.K. war would define legacy, likely planted car bomb maybe killed Hal one Kate’s advisers — somewhat anticlimactic.
like similarities initial Iran setup Diplomat Terminal List, ends like series, too, well Tom Clancy’s Without Remorse Night Agent. projects start seemingly international (often Middle Eastern Muslim) foes targeting western service members eventually ending “the betrayal coming inside government along” reveal. approach — setting rest world universally bad turncoat government official lone bad actor within well-intentioned institution — evermore stagnant. Diplomat, despite insistence otherwise, old conversation.
