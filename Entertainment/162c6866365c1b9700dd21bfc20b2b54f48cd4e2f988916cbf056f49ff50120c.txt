2014 episode podcast Norm Macdonald Live, Norm Macdonald tells story. It’s set tenure writing Roseanne ’90s, showrunner Roseanne Barr used “give jobs crazy guys.” case, Macdonald says gave job Black stand-up comic named David apparently previous TV-writing experience spent two silent years Roseanne writers’ room announcing one day idea show. Macdonald switches higher-pitched blaccent recites idea: “What would happen Dan came home Roseanne washing big ass sink?” writers room provisionally approve pitch. “Yeah, thing is,” Macdonald continues David, “it ain’t Roseanne, it’s twin sister.” Another writer pipes up, “We already Jackie,” referring Roseanne’s sister played Laurie Metcalf, time three consecutive Emmys role. blaccent returns more, time little muted, Macdonald underplays punch line: “Who Jackie?!”
Comedy writers telling “Who Jackie” story offices, table reads, Sweetgreens nearly 30 years. started circulating 1995 among employees Radford lot Studio City, eventually made way onto lots writers’ rooms, winking references began popping sitcoms like Name Earl and30 Rock.
“I can’t remember knowing story,” says Modern Family creator Steve Levitan, invoked “Who Jackie” 2022 Hulu series Reboot.
“That story told, least referenced, every writers’ room I’ve in,” says former Corporate showrunner Jake Fogelnest, made “Who Jackie” T-shirts friends.
“It’s story that’s mythological within reach,” says former 30 Rock writer Vali Chandrasekaran. “Because feels like it’s existed forever, also, everyone sort knows someone there.”
Like best stories, two people tell exactly alike. Certainly 12 former Roseanne writers 20 comedians TV creators interviewed journey sitcom lore determine happened day 1995. Sometimes “Who Jackie” long, winding tale full flourishes; sometimes spans spartan sentences; sometimes it’s Ghost Variation. Specifics vary around details like writer’s name, relationship Barr, long he’d staffed show without aware Jackie character. story always punch line — blaccent optional. It’s like “The Aristocrats” meets Rashomon: retelling reveals nearly much person tweaking story itself. Even it’s coming mythical David himself.
Part I: Incredibly Deep Bench
lot writers falsely claimed room “Who Jackie” story took place. lies would easier disprove involved show, Roseanne famous unwieldy writing staff. average network sitcom 2023 10 15 writers; contrast, eighth season, “Who Jackie” story played out, Roseanne somewhere 25 32. show many writers Barr gave numbered T-shirts wear fifth season, ostensibly joke. Frequent turnover added chaos. Barr — didn’t respond interview requests article — reportedly fired writers often, later hired back, developed unofficial rule: fires you, go home come back next morning like nothing happened.
many Roseanne writers mostly scattered throughout floor Radford lot, many classic shows era, including Seinfeld Larry Sanders Show, written filmed. staff rarely together except table reads; instead, highest-ranking writers producers worked main room, everyone else rotations satellite rooms developing scenes, punching scripts, churning jokes. Former Roseanne showrunner Eric Gilliland remembers sending writers room brainstorm episode titles. “She sorta kept hiring people, job figure them,” says. “Someone would ask, ‘Can take day off?’ ‘Go! Take three days. It’s fine.’”
staff Roseanne divided veteran TV writers, novices plucked stand-up circuit — Macdonald among group — miscellaneous others culled deep end talent pool. “Roseanne hired funny friends spot, spec script required,” says former writer Ritch Shydner. According another former writer, Danny Zuker, Barr “would go comedy clubs, would suddenly bartender club room. hires fantastic, since long careers right bring in, others friends nefarious connections don’t want say.”
“Roseanne affinity prop people,” says Mike Costa, former prop master Barr promoted season seven, making first Black writer show’s history. “We down-to-earth guys, like regular blue-collar person too.”
“Who Jackie” writer ended Roseanne changes depending who’s telling version, he’s typically introduced someone business working TV show, even though least true part story.
Part II: David?
accurate part Macdonald’s version events “Who Jackie” writer Black stand-up comic named David. It’s easy enough verify identity there. three Davids credited IMDb writers Roseanne period story took place, Googling leads Reddit thread r/NormMacdonald 2017 whether David Forbes guy. (He isn’t.)
one comment thread, redditor unceremoniously announces David “was corny Black comic,” separate thread sub-Reddit offers name “David Tyree,” along clip extremely early-’90s stand-up. it, confident-looking dude chunky high-top fade rimless glasses glides across stage. He’s wearing black blazer button-up looks like Saved Bell opening credits. voice booming, buttery timbre, uses say things like, “Everybody calls Folgers ’cause I’m dark rich,” “You women call coffee ’cause grind fine.” Beneath video, bunch comments read, “Who Jackie.”
Although never found full-on mainstream success, David Tyree several near-brushes fame. cast minor role David Brenner’s 1976 sitcom, Snip, canceled ever aired. Mitzi Shore “passed” Comedy Store, 1980s like getting initiated Skull Bones Society comedians. became fixture Store, friends everyone — time Richard Pryor Sam Kinison still around — mentored lot greener comics coming ranks.
“Tyree one headliners would always stay watch went on,” says Mark Fernandez, another Comedy Store regular days.
“He essentially Mr. Miyagi stand-up comedy,” says John Kreng, comic era went design action scenes movies. remembers opening Tyree Comedy Store La Jolla Tyree suffered family tragedy. visibly shaken discussed incident private, went onstage, told story packed crowd — subtle changes timing word emphasis — killed.
“When somebody’s hot, everybody notices, seems like they’re next one pop. always felt like Tyree pop,” says mononymous comedian Dante. “But didn’t.”
Looking back, sure came close. stand-up clip Reddit comes Rodney Dangerfield’s 1991 HBO special, Really Big Show. Another version YouTube starts minutes earlier presents Tyree flattering light. special opens sketch Tyree Dangerfield getting side-by-side massages “Hollywood Health Spa.” Dangerfield pretends suddenly realize rubdown neighbor proceeds beg Tyree open HBO special. happens next might 1991 twist imaginable: Mr. bursts doors Hollywood Health Spa.
“David Tyree! told here,” says Mr. T. “Hey, man. love you. Matter fact, everybody loves you. keep taking care yourself. want around long time. You’re best, baby. best!” Although joke here, ever, Dangerfield gets respect, come Tyree’s expense. Instead, entire setup preserves amber Tyree’s high status comedy world time.
Part III: Another Joke Shoveler Engine Room
first time tried get touch Tyree DMing professional Facebook page, auto-reply announced, “Buy book CD … I’m trying retire comfort.” contact page website, dozen years date feels Geocities-ancient, yielded response either. Eventually, stumbled upon link Tyree’s private Facebook account, couple weeks, replied follow-up message there: “I’m trying rude don’t anything related show business. gave 40 years gave little.”
couple months later, another former Roseanne writer nudged him, Tyree agreed talk phone. voice longer carries much bass ’80s, far rasp crept decades since, still sounds like professional funny person. Every then, conversation, breaks manic giggle fit — usually something he’s said — sounds much younger 75 years.
Tyree says Barr first crossed paths 1980s stand-up circuit midst rapid rise fame. According him, promised get job writing show Roseanne’s first season 1988. waited entire year call giving hope heading tour. finally gave interview show’s seventh season.
Contrary “Who Jackie” story often told, Tyree entirely without television-writing experience Roseanne. says apprenticed TV legend Norman Lear 1970s sold couple scripts What’s Happening!! around time. also says hired play one leads Bosom Buddies, ’80s dudes-in-drag sitcom launched Tom Hanks, role recast Peter Scolari. (“They gave nice check,” Tyree says.) credentials didn’t impress executive interviewing Roseanne job, despite Barr’s direct referral. Tyree remembers it, interviewer kept asking recent writing credits Barr — either listening outside happened walking moment — popped head doorway said, “Just hire shut fuck up.”
Former Roseanne writer Ed Yeager recalls day Barr showed Radford lot two new hires: Tyree another stand-up named Charlie Hill, giant world Native American comedy. show recently fallen Nielsen ratings No. 4 spot season six No. 9 season seven, two turn tide ahead season eight.
“That’s way put it,” Yeager remembers. “Charlie David came in, never TV writers before, came responsibility save show.”
“She always saying stuff like that: ‘If fucking assholes can’t it, I’m gonna get guys funny,’” adds former writer David Raether. “Then would bring people, would lost were.”
Zuker describes Tyree affable time overlapped staff, albeit particularly plugged show. “I don’t think got jokes pitched onto show verbatim, always pitched good areas,” Raether says. “He would pitch joke would quite right, could fix would work Roseanne.”
Tyree says hardest part new job part massive writing staff whose members often opposing ideas considered funny. former Roseanne staffers came show TV-writing novices remember feeling similarly disadvantaged. “Everybody hyped excited room, it’s gladiator pit there, trying get joke in,” says Costa, former prop master. “I’m already fighting uphill: I’m prop scum, I’m Black guy, it’s first writing job. It’s heat moment, you’ve got bullets flying past you, you’re crawling ground musket, say something. That’s like room.”
might known Jackie was, motherfucking showrunners didn’t know shit.
Shydner, joined staff world stand-up, remembers frustrating whiplash effect getting jokes rejected handful writer-producers rather packed crowd comedy-club patrons either laugh don’t. “It difficult adjust total control ship another joke shoveler engine room,” says. Tyree chafed hierarchy show, developing “us vs. them” mentality pitted fellow stand-ups show’s gatekeepers. chance writer-producers ever going find amicable working rhythm, Tyree claims fell apart one particular table read.
Prior table read, producers shot joke Tyree pitched Johnny Galecki’s character, David, hinged David saying, “I spell.” (“I don’t remember joke,” Tyree says. “I know David David dumbass.”) table read, Barr didn’t like joke team landed on. Tyree mentioned he’d pitched good one shot down. Barr asked it, recited line, Tyree claims laughed ordered producers put script. “They hated that,” says.
Although none producers interviewed especially complimentary Tyree, don’t remember harboring animosity toward him, either. Tyree less diplomatic appraisal them. “They fucking clue write show,” says. “I might known Jackie was, motherfucking showrunners didn’t know shit.”
Part IV: Room Happened
“Who Jackie” story occurred point Roseanne’s eighth season, kicked fall 1995. Yeager claims happened Tyree’s first day, right Barr introduced Hill writers would “save show.” Yeager remembers showrunner Gilliland greeting Tyree Hill copy latest script asking read it. two returned short later, Gilliland asked whether questions. Tyree apparently one: “Who Jackie?”
“It wasn’t remarkable moment,” Yeager says. “Just guy saying something stupid first day work.”
Others remember differently. Roseanne writers Zuker Raether insist Tyree least weeks already. Gilliland says months: “The reason dumbfounded while.” nobody spoke thought anywhere close two years Macdonald suggested podcast.
Another thing writers unsure exactly led defining moment story. Macdonald’s memory Tyree’s “washing big ass sink” pitch rings bell multiple writers, none confident it’s prompted question.
“That sink idea pitch Dave, think happened different day,” Gilliland says. “That another one jaws ground.”
Tyree doesn’t remember pitching sink idea day either. fact, doesn’t remember pitching anything. Instead, recalls going first table read hiatus seasons, hearing writers pitching lines Jackie, knowing hell talking about.
former Roseanne writers give Tyree benefit doubt familiar character briefly got confused. Costa suggests Tyree mainly knew Jackie “Laurie,” Laurie Metcalf, since character sometimes referred room names interchangeably.
“I totally ignorant characters show. Totally,” Tyree admits. “I may going sour grapes watched damn show didn’t get job supposed get long. didn’t watch Cheers either, Cheers No. 1. didn’t watch comedy shows television thought on. couldn’t it. said, ‘I don’t wanna watch someone else get check. Fuck that!’”
apocryphal version “Who Jackie” — Ghost Variation — Tyree continues spouting ideas sink pitch, suggests Jackie die become ghost make room show Roseanne’s ass-washing twin sister.
Yeager least explain rumor’s origins. “I impressions everyone, sometimes would pitch story David Tyree, delight everyone room,” says. “And one day pitched story Tyree saying, ‘Jackie die go heaven, start flyin’ around room, everyone start prayin’ her.’ racist, mean, everyone laughed, made go around room room impression.” Somehow, enough people connected Roseanne ended familiar Yeager’s impression eventually got tangled “Who Jackie” lore.
“I always felt like telling children Santa Claus told people part story didn’t actually happen,” Zuker says.
Another heavily disputed piece “Who Jackie” puzzle happened right Tyree asked notorious question. Raether says one writers leaned asked Tyree, “Have ever seen show?” sending everyone hysterics. Former Roseanne writer Bob Nickman recalls everyone “laughed gave [Tyree] shit.” Writer Lois Bromfield also remembers room breaking laughter, Costa.
Yeager says stunned silence writers made different rooms, laughing begin. Gilliland believes long uncomfortable pause ensued, gently explained character Jackie Tyree, sat there, unfazed.
Here’s Tyree describes happened: “The whole table looked like fuckin’ moon. Everyone laughed, said, ‘I’m serious, don’t know fuck Jackie is.’”
Zuker started new job writer-producer Grace Fire time, show’s offices also Radford lot, directly common area Roseanne. remembers hearing explosive laughter day former co-workers came running upstairs lunch tell “Who Jackie” story. “What made legend me,” says, “is within 24 hours, you’d walking around Radford lot hearing people say, ‘Who Jackie?’ leaving next night, heard two security guards saying, ‘Who Jackie?’ laughing asses off.”
would soon joined many others.
Part V: Intergenerational Game TV-Writer Telephone
Perhaps Radford lot home many collegiate writers’ rooms, maybe simply consequence rapid-fire hiring-and-firing practices Roseanne sent writing staff packing series. whatever reason, years come, “Who Jackie” spread across town. pre-social-media equivalent viral meme.
“I amazed would meeting another show, one first questions would ‘Who Jackie?’” Yeager says. “Anytime met show Roseanne, anyone meeting wanted hear it. Everybody knew. everyone cell phones shit.” Zuker cites seeing Liz Lemon say “Who Jackie” fifth-season premiere 30 Rock 2010 moment realized story entered higher level public consciousness. wasn’t first “Who Jackie” made TV. wasn’t even first one 30 Rock — Liz Lemon already said words previous season.
Years earlier, Jason Lee’s titular character mid-aughts hit Name Earl would often blurt “Who Jackie.” either exclamation punctuation, mainly Easter egg viewers know. (“It’s always fun jokes 30 people get millions watching,” creator Greg Garcia says DVD commentary episode side character revealed screen name “whojackie.”)
time went on, references started getting brazen. story eventually found way Tina Fey–created Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt 2015 — riffing Ghost Variation, less. tenth episode first season, Kimmy’s love interest Dong works man named Hu Zha Qi — pronounced “Who Jackie” — gets mad Dong hopes loud Dong “die, become ghost,” “fly around room.”
nod story even popped ill-fated reboot Roseanne launched 2018 swiftly got canceled, reasons need relitigated here,before reconfigured Conners, fifth season. one point reboot’s second episode, Sara Gilbert’s character Darlene asks Roseanne, “Where’s Dad?” “He’s kitchen,” Roseanne responds. “He’s washing tail sink.” Darlene Hunt, credited writer episode, claims memory conversations around joke “or correlation ‘Who Jackie’ story.”
recent “Who Jackie” make TV, October 2022 finale Hulu’s Reboot, marks first time story isn’t referenced, actually explained. Well, almost.
Veteran sitcom writer Gordon (Paul Reiser) heated confrontation executive, novice sitcom-writer daughter Hannah (Rachel Bloom) tries convince apologize. Gordon refuses. “Writers town gonna talking story years,” says pride. “It’s gonna like new ‘Who Jackie.’” Hannah confused. idea father talking about. look delight spreads across Gordon’s face realizes gets tell daughter “Who Jackie” story. gets two seconds it, however, Hannah cuts off. “I truly don’t care,” says.
Chandrasekaran claims story “doesn’t ping around writers’ rooms much now” back wrote 30 Rock. days, exists utilitarian reference point torch-passing lore new generation TV writers.
“If anyone named Jack Jackie way, it’ll often come up,” Zuker says. “If anybody forgets name somebody know — someone making fun forgetting, would way they’d it.”
Fogelnest recalls hearing writers’ room 2012 someone impersonating Tyree telling story, Black writer walked asked everyone laughing about. writer repeated story without impression, fell flat — others urged tell using “the voice” like first time.
much phrase “Who Jackie” become indelible comedy-world in-joke, story often function narrative hall pass people use blaccent. tellings, especially Ghost Variation, humor depends almost entirely central figure racially coded caricature. ​​“When Norm Macdonald told story, he’s like, ‘There’s guy room — Black guy,’” Costa says. “And I’m listening thinking, hell Black ‘Who Jackie’? It’s got nothing it. There’s reason mention ethnicity context blunder made.”
“At point funny story,” Fogelnest asks, “and point story human butt joke wealthy privileged television writers drive Teslas lot keep people writers’ room 10 p.m. don’t want see wife kids?”
“Those thoughts story now,” adds, “while still thinking it’s funniest story ever.”
Part VI: Credit Due
Tyree left Roseanne end eighth season — doesn’t remember let go; others — wrote shows like Malcolm & Eddie late ’90s Mind Mencia early aughts. also played bit parts little-seen films like 2006’s Made Potatoe Salad. “I best three years, still couldn’t get goddamn TV show,” Tyree says. continued performing stand-up trying sell TV pilots retired 2010 age 62. now, thinks “Who Jackie” story long subject speculation.
career’s over, I’m sayin’: would nice know one didn’t know Jackie was.
truth, Tyree idea story going around enough feel one way another. got first hint epic trajectory story still mostly confined Radford lot. heading car one day work someone yelled him: “Who Jackie?” Perhaps one security guards Zuker remembers enamored story. Tyree can’t recall whether even anyone knew, didn’t feel pressed taunted.
“I looked him,” recalls. “Because me, wasn’t big deal. kept smiling, going car. might even laughed. thought funny someone remembered said, even though ignorance.” adds, “I didn’t mean funny — said ignorant — funny, happy funny. That’s we’re funny.”
Knowing knows now, however, Tyree one request.
“I wish they’d mention fuckin’ name,” says “Who Jackie” storytellers. “There’s thing bad publicity. Everybody who’s gotten bad publicity, career goes up. career’s over, I’m sayin’: would nice know one didn’t know Jackie was.”
