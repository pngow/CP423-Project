Hansberry’s play holds people like Mavis, Sidney, Iris light inspection. What’s done selfish, self-regarding purported allies? Then, like someone cutting open rough-hewn rock, sets actions plot upon them. play harsh, pares hero down, reveals something hopeful. Sidney, posting sign isn’t much itself, goads onward, way Greek tragedy pushes everyone toward calamity clarity sight. Hansberry hope that, gesture, streak actual commitment might revealed Sidney like vein gold.
