Warning: recap first three episodes Love & Death: “The Huntress,” “Encounters,” “Stepping Stone.”
extramarital affair center new Max miniseries Love & Death completely quotidian: Two fairly unremarkable mostly well-meaning denizens suburban Texas, long-standing marriages people, wind bed together escape frustrations stable always satisfying regular lives. makes Candy Montgomery (Elizabeth Olsen) Allan Gore (Jesse Plemons) compelling first isn’t necessarily they’re played familiar actors imitating normal American family 1978; even pre-existing true-crime notoriety happens affair. (Enough another bunch well-known actors played last year Hulu miniseries Candy.) No, makes affair Candy Allan oddly mesmerizing, least first three episodes series, methodical deliberateness — passionate coupling that’s nonetheless arranged square, fumbling awkwardness, along faintest hint clinical chill.
attraction isn’t manufactured, least Candy’s side. merest casual brush Allan church-sponsored volleyball game seems react chemically dissatisfaction lurking beneath one classic suburban façades. Suddenly, light nerdy husband, Pat (Patrick Fugit Almost Famous), showing interest Rodney Dangerfield Tonight Show reading writing-class short story, Candy yearns something new. It’s Allan picture escapism; early “The Huntress,” show’s first episode, wife, Betty (Lily Rabe), excuse post-church gossip session kind unsexy, mostly clothed, instruction-filled, conception-focused sex often used heavy-handed cue marriage drained passion spontaneity.
Viewers Love & Death see this, course, Candy doesn’t, there’s never sense suspects secret sexual prowess lurks beneath Allan’s quiet, dutiful exterior. (In words, he’s Jesse Plemons character, taking Patrick Wilson characters next level hapless quasi-dependability.) later tells bestie, Sherry (Krysten Ritter), “smelled like sex” admits may simple matter smell: pheromones genuine human connection. scenes “The Huntress” Candy verbalizes desires acting probably true life, context series, don’t seem strictly necessary. show, written directed TV veterans David E. Kelley Lesli Linka Glatter, respectively, best observes desires Candy’s calculations pursuing close-ups Elizabeth Olsen’s face. “You best commentary silence” something Allan says, little exasperated, unhappy wife, applies Olsen’s performance here, too.
Candy talking feelings Sherry also seems unnecessary diminishes shocks nonetheless deeply strange (and therefore quite effective) scenes Candy takes Allan aside lets know she’s thinking: him, quite often. eventually asks affair way high-school girl era might take initiative asking boy movies, parent might ask neighbor join PTA committee: “Would interested affair?” context busy, put-together housewife asking, seems like Candy employing kind therapy self-help approach infidelity, something show vaguely connects kind Decade experimentation taking place ’60s wildness. third episode, announces new mantra “rediscover me.”
result emphasis formality practicality: “Shall set date affair begin?” Allan asks “Huntress,” pushing boundary believability they’ve agreed want pursue it. Much first episode consists long lead-up. Candy Allan don’t meet discuss possibility; series meetings seems like several weeks, employing multiple pro-and-con lists flip-chart rules. pure suburban dorkiness kind kink expression? likely bit both, though fact Candy realizes (or assumes loud, without contradiction correct her) Allan may never tongue-kissed makes pre-affair fastidiousness seem like former. increased focus pleasure, rather “fornication,” Betty refers second episode, Candy Allan still don’t take clothes way off.
Candy, though, perhaps extensiveness planning something game. rules include demands utmost care secrecy, even though Candy already told multiple people prospective affair begins (though Sherry knows Allan-related specifics). six minutes second episode, “Encounters,” Betty notices meaningful looks husband woman.
second episode follows affair blooms starts wane; third episode takes show aftermath affair, right middle might call Fateful Day. (The particular fatefulness described loglines Love & Death; let’s say involves ax, though it’s really wielded first triptych episodes.) unusual affair’s origins are, arc pretty familiar, makes “Encounters” “Stepping Stone” less grabby first hour. Candy performs domesticity, making impeccable picnic-ready lunches Allan eat sleazy (though modern point-of-view, retro-chic!) motel, neatly showering afterward; Allan enjoys elevated moods even thinks affair helping marriage.
it’s quite. Betty grows gives birth second child, feels increasingly neglected depressed. Allan agrees take weekend Marriage Encounter, real extant thing churchgoing couples supposed reconnect share feelings. Allan doesn’t confess affair, shares feelings Betty, marriage improves. means beginning “Stepping Stone,” Allan doesn’t think affair Candy go even though passivity essentially leaves Candy messy business deciding whether end it. cuts lost carefree emotional detachment situation.
It’s sometimes hard tell, first three episodes, self-aware and/or self-deluded Candy supposed be. repeated shot smoking dark balcony implies kind secret brooding beneath chipper exterior. Still, attempts put happy face suburban angst pretty convincing: tells Sherry despite Allan’s “perfectly shaped penis” (!), he’s exactly champion bedroom performer (this seems true), post-affair, won’t miss sex much friendship. Though somewhat rude thing say actual best friend, speak sometimes-uncomfortable human networks form around churches communities; they’re seeing other, Allan Candy often discuss Betty she’s mutual friend, Allan’s wife.
Similarly, it’s always easy get bead supporting characters like Pat: revealing depth Candy attend Marriage Encounter session “Stepping Stone”? first enrages quoting Carole King lyrics place feelings, appears move explaining it; earlier scene, apparent rejection Candy’s question they’re backed surprising thoughtfulness, even tenderness. Betty, too, sees shifts could character changes could audience getting distance lead characters’ points view.
true-crime show spend time characters nudging toward Fateful Day, case means dramatizing gradual ebb long-term affair that’s built last. Roughly year half passes course episodes two three, nonetheless fails sync Allan Betty’s younger child seems yo-yo age size (at one point, she’s clearly aged five six months, newborn-size gurgling subsequent scene). That’s minor nitpick sign that, ultimately, people bit like pieces moving around board it’s time characters find affair.
do, seemingly unrelated incidents “Stepping Stone”: Pat, looking old love letter, finds one Allan wrote Candy. Betty, meanwhile, appears simply intuit connection shared Candy husband. doesn’t come obviously risky things two together (like dining together public, albeit “out town,” chatting phone day), simply focus, increasing horror, mildly friendly body language two linger Candy’s car, finishing conversation Candy checks Betty following doctor visit (she lump breast, it’s benign). Later, Candy pops Gores’ place one busy supermom errands, Betty confronts long-dormant affair: First quiet fury, … something else. Something ax-shaped. last shot like something horror movie, kind moment makes gradual ebb affair seem lot sudden retrospect.
Love Notes
• read nonfiction book Love & Death based on, familiar case apart usual Wikipedia outlines, I’m going much fact-checking real case Candy Montgomery. Rather, I’ll looking Love & Death drama series part “true crime” genre piece of, well, truth.
• Soundtrack watch: Oh, man, there’s certainly something said period pieces don’t feel need dig deep cuts vanishingly normal-presenting American families would jamming 1978, Love & Death really pushes limits normie needle-drops first three episodes, breaking obscurities like “Stayin’ Alive” “I’ve Gotta Get Message You” Bee Gees, “Piece Heart” Janis Joplin, “Turn Beat Around” Vicki Sue Robinson, “Baby I’m Burnin’” Dolly Parton, among others. I’m sure particularly taxing music-supervising gig, I’m saying.
• action colored, necessarily informed, Methodist church drama: first episode, Pastor Jackie Ponder (Elizabeth Marvel) leaves church, much consternation Betty, alienated arrival fussy, uncharismatic young replacement (Keir Gilchrist, Follows). inspires nicely written Kelley line Allan, explains wife doesn’t love change even particularly “like contingencies.”
• Period watch: really big pop-culture-saturated show, first episode features family trip see Grease theaters, third episode takes place largely day family plans see big summer movie Empire Strikes Back.
• Kelley, wrote seven episodes show, Glatter, directed first four, storied TV careers stretching back days network domination. Kelley, course, created Picket Fences, Practice, Ally McBeal, personal (fairly ridiculous) favorite, Boston Public, among others, flailing bit pivoting time-consuming job Nicole Kidman’s streaming whisperer. Kidman starred hisBig Little Lies,Nine Perfect Strangers, Undoing, produces here. Glatter, meanwhile, directed episodes stunning number all-timer shows: Twin Peaks, NYPD Blue, Freaks Geeks, Mad Men CV. Needless say, neither worked Candy.
