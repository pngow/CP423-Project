entire season like one giant puzzle try figure Midge Susie become industry superstars — colossal falling circa 1985. “The Pirate Queen” doesn’t answer questions exactly, gets us closer truth providing critical corner pieces.
episode opens flash-forward 1987, greying, pudgy Joel Maisel serving time prison. 55-year-old Midge visiting, hot brisket tow. prosthetics Michael Zegen Rachel Brosnahan great, btw. don’t find Joel end prison, mentions fights among fellow inmates “over copies Financial Times,” deduce he’s white-collar crime. and, instead cigarettes, Joel uses autographed headshots Midge currency inside. there’s nothing like knowing cellmate jerking famous ex-wife.
There’s also Weissman-Maisel family news. Ethan Israeli wife, Chava, daughter named Rose. Knowing it’s Jewish tradition name babies deceased relatives, took mean 1987, Midge’s mother died. Midge talks mother “rolling grave,” suspicions confirmed. May memory blessing, Rose Weissman. Sadly, Joel hasn’t met first grandchild looks forward “four six months.” don’t know long Joel behind bars, least he’s getting soon.
discussion turns Midge’s career, gone creatively downhill since Susie Mrs. Maisel parted ways. Instead performing stand-up, Midge shilling “high-quality” wigs large paychecks. Yeesh. Joel mentions Susie would hate Midge doing, Midge shuts mention former manager. leads biggest clue Joel’s criminal activities: Midge Joel argue insistence protect ex-wife (something we’ll see play later episode). Midge retorts, “And look got you.”
Considering Joel found Susie tied mobsters, it’s looking like got involved save Midge. that’s true, deserves every bite homemade brisket.
Back “present day” 1961, business booming Susie Myerson Associates: line door prospective clients phone ringing hook. Susie wants answer hotshot Hollywood producer David Weston, auditioned client James Howard (a.k.a. comedian Dinah discovered last season) next big picture.
Gordon Ford Show, Gordon executive producer George odds late-night host isn’t fan show’s latest sponsor, “Ditty-Doo Diaper Cream.” (Can blame him?) Plus, George went Gordon’s head committed splashy boat cruise company’s reps. Gordon refuses attend, George all, um, bad optics, much? Midge offers save day attending bash telling “a million diaper jokes.” George math: comic + mom = ka-ching!
pause central narrative wedding Zelda Janusz. bride groom wed home beloved employers, Rose Abe Weissman Miriam Maisel. bride wears traditional Polish gown headdress ecstatic tie knot place “with [her] memories cleaning products.” Janusz announces vows wants wife stop working enjoy life together, panic ensues among privileged assholes attendance. Suddenly, Rose Abe deeply confused cook clean, Midge Joel realize they’re lose childcare. Wedding etiquette rule number one: Anyone literally stops wedding ceremony ask bride last day work cocktail party clients next month awful person. awful person made laugh, awful person, nonetheless.
Zelda spends wedding reception teaching Rose Abe vacuum, Midge Joel drink fire escape. It’s Joel starts pressing Midge Frank Nicky. Joel disagrees ex-wife’s assessment they’re “friendly thugs” because, unlike Midge, knows last week’s “garbage gig” wasn’t end deal Susie. Also, unlike Midge, Joel experience mob: He’s spent past year forming tenuous relationship powerful Chinatown family. Joel, rightfully, isn’t letting subject go, matter much Midge tells back matter many times two engage make-out seshes. Yep, guess that’s he’s prison 25 years later. I’ve never Team Joel, like he’s held accountable since destroying marriage Midge.
Apparently, Susie miss Zelda-Janusz nuptials spent episode chasing David Weston New York. eventually corners guy gay bathhouse men entertained redheaded female singer male pianist. know Susie master hard sell. knew could pull hard sell fully clothed middle steamy bathhouse? Susie pitches James one last time Weston, proving she’ll go ends earth clients touch reverse psychology. leaves bathhouse dignity intact — despite forcing way nude conga line — leaving final decision Weston.
Susie’s evening isn’t long shot. Midge, decked gorgeous blue sailor dress, huge hit George Ditty Doo Diaper Cream reps boat cruise. spots one male reps aggressively hitting female server steps girl escape. Midge messes around guy’s expensive jacket, accidentally falls water. She’s hauled away Coast Guard handcuffs.
emergency meeting subsequently takes place Gordon Ford offices, Midge tells truth: trying help one female servers diaper cream rep got handsy. George, however, typical male exec fashion, insists nothing “untoward” occurred Midge “assaulted” man question. Suddenly, I’m feeling Mike Carr-sanctioned blind rage toward guy too. Ah, misogyny, ruining women’s lives since, well, forever.
case assault. Midge reveals folks gathered — Mike, Susie, Gordon, NBC legal PR reps — since boat far enough, arrest might classified international incident (“France may weigh in”). wait, there’s more: Since harasser’s wallet jacket, international waters, money considered “treasure,” Midge officially committed “an act piracy.”
Fortunately Midge, Gordon Mike laugh hysterically absurd scenario. George, however, steadfastly remains on-brand failing find humor. Much exec producer’s chagrin, Gordon keeps Midge payroll gets charges dropped. Adding insult injury, Gordon squarely puts blame George disobeying orders first place. (Ooof, Peter Friedman’s characters aren’t good week career-wise, they?)
Midge Susie may relieved, Mike positively giddy George’s ineffectiveness becoming liability. “I wasn’t happy kids born!” gushes. words great Susie Myerson: “You’re sick fuck, Mike.”
Speaking great Susie Myerson: next morning, she’s talk town! non-musical version “The Telephone Hour,” industry dudes gabbing like schoolgirls fueling rumor mill dozens stories Susie really got David Weston cast James Howard latest film. Susie, meanwhile, basking success getting brand-new bespoke suit. Woo-hoo, Susie!!!!!
Unfortunately Midge, she’s still waiting big break. happens, must set firm boundaries newest fan, Gordon Ford. promising turn events, Gordon catches one Midge’s downtown sets, dinner City Spoon, charming TV host confesses he’s scouting sex appeal, talent. He’s holding tight no-staff-on-the-show mandate (groan). she’s wisely holding tight keeping things platonic she’s letting arbitrary rule stop her. — “if” — gets show, needs know it’s she’s funny, she’s “Gordon’s girl.”
Finally accepting defeat, Gordon invites Midge dance middle diner, split second, wish two would get together. Midge totally right thing here. Besides, even though she’ll multiple failed marriages, think know heart always belong Joel.
Maisel Musings!
• Okay, know timeline-wise, duo bathhouse isn’t Bette Midler Barry Manilow we’re decade early famed Continental Baths performances. homage, right? Especially considering Susie’s later comments Dinah Maggie signed great new cabaret singer. (FWIW, Midler still teenager 1961 didn’t move New York 1965.)
• Sometimes it’s good idea stick around closing credits might hear Tim Curry singing “A Professional Pirate” Muppet Treasure Island.
