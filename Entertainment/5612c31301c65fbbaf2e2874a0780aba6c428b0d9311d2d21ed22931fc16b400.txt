Search feelings, know true: Mandalorian season three okay, maybe aggressively so. tough gig next Star Wars premiere brilliance Andor, Jon Favreau’s Disney+ darling still hallmarks jetpacks cute creatures — wasn’t much them, Din Djarin (Pedro Pascal, partly) Grogu (Grogu) took backseat Bo-Katan’s (Katee Sackhoff) retaking Mandalore. Despite this, plenty critters found trio bounced planet planet, including familiar haunts like Nevarro Mandalore, new locales, like Lizzo Jack Black’s outer-rim palace — many lay space animals ranking.
Now, since Star Wars universe vast aliens creatures, we’ve decided rank non-sentient races, meaning Babu Frik’s Anzellan brethren count. (That also, unfortunately, includes mossy Chia Pet pirate Gorian Shard tentacle-sucking lovers episode six, too.) tried best name creatures, aren’t exactly billed credits, occasionally named descriptive audio. Justice creatures!
winged alligator Mandalore tries attack Grogu quickly scurries Din’s ship, gives alligator automatic last place spot! He’s cute even worse, fails immediately. Grogu didn’t even use force, closed door ship gator. Embarrassing!
lumped together menagerie mini, multicolor creatures flying around Lizzo Jack Black (I refuse learn Star Wars names) inside couple’s lavish dining hall. tiny creatures range pseudo-ceiling fans adorable table knickknacks — though, would want around food? — ultimately they’re decorations Plazir-15, nothing more.
8. Reptavian Babies (Chapter 20)
babies would possibly rank higher show followed becoming actual Mandalorian foundlings — imagine training Grogu’s side! — didn’t look like bug-eyed sphynx cat. Jon Favreau Dave Filoni probably didn’t want tackle icky implications Mandalorian cult killing mother indoctrinating group. Hm, I’m thinking spinoff baby reptavians grow seek revenge Mandalorians. Though, mother’s murderer already dead, RIP. Moving on!
7. Pill Bug (Chapter 22)

pit girls other, croquet-pill bug less-cute offshoot Alice Wonderland’s croquet hedgehog, though I’m sure may disagree. croquet Plazir-15 look less deadly Wonderland, nonetheless, lose exquisite scenery beautifully trimmed rose bushes flamingo mallets. love mechanics throwing pill bug, though. Kudos Lizzo, points creativity!
creature one list chomp Mandalorian like cousin, T. Rex Jurassic Park. timing attack Mandalorians found refuge turf simply hilarious. one provoked her, yet sprang water hell-bent like Bride Kill Bill. Despite inexplicable aggression, death though really uncalled for. gnarly, too. Chunks everywhere!
5. Secretion Creature (Chapter 22)

Plazir-15 full rich freaks, brings us secretion creature. little green slime ball harvested juices, space royals generals apparently love drink! Secretion creature doesn’t cuteness factor, way everyone’s enthusiastically slurping slime, imagine goo espresso martinis galaxy far, far away, maybe it’s worth sip.
4. Stone Crabs (Chapter 20)

Simple yet greatly amusing, stone crabs good time. don’t bother anyone! stone crabs precious species, Marcel Shells space. Honestly, give guest role Andor take beaches Niamos. Even Grogu fascinated enough immediately eat them.
3. Purrgils (Chapter 17)

majestic creature, it’s hard properly rank purrgils they’re reason hyperspace travel exists. They’re simply “It” girls galaxy far, far away, even though Mandalorian viewers probably wouldn’t know hadn’t watched Star Wars: Rebels. purrgils’ shrouded tease Grogu adorable, that, tease. soon get purrgils full live-action view, they’ll shoot top list. Maybe Ahsoka?
lives! Mythosaur provided one coolest reveals whole season Bo-Katan caught glimpse mythical beast waters Mandalore. season even ended look precious wide eyes massive Mythosaur (almost makes forget formidable creature are), definitely coming. Wouldn’t cool Mandalorian ends Pascal Grogu riding hailed creature, ever gets back suit.
It’s time Mandalorians got taste medicine. bounce planet planet killing area’s nativecreatures, Mandalore trinitaur dished pain dramatically death-dropping onto group’s ship sea. Sure, maybe Mandos trying reclaim homeland wasn’t ideal timing, it’s home too! almost thought Mythosaur first, that’s large majestic is. Now, may use term lightly sometimes, mean here: Despite 30 seconds screen time, she’s iconic.
