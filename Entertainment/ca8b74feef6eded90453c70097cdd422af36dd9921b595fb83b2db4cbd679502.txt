following interview edited length clarity.
so-called Romanian New Wave already started 2007 really blew internationally Palme d’Or 4 Months, 3 Weeks 2 Days, film took career, sort entire movement, new level. 16 years on, think focus Romanian cinema changed? outsider’s perspective, seemed first wave films dealing communist period Nicolae Ceaușescu. new films Romanian, including latest, R.M.N., seem concerned current-day events.
Well, don’t think speaking, even then, communism particular, think age, revisit adolescence or, know, youth. making films kind nostalgia lived through. course, communism background, talking experiences. remember, Corneliu Porumboiu’s first film, one revolution [2006’s 12:08 East Bucharest], wasn’t much communism. Cristi Puiu’s second film [2005’s Death Mr. Lazarescu] wasn’t communism. quite contemporary, speaking long-term effects communism people, way country shaped people shaped.
don’t think new wave got attention speaking communism. mostly, speaking different way, different cinematic way. think formal thing, dragged attention way. way making films very, long takes, deliberate. Behind new wave, lot thinking limits cinema art, particularities. That’s shooting long takes, like master shots, there’s integrity time, cinema preserve, condition don’t use editing.
think motivating one another really think deeply cinema, take seriously. point us making popular films because, moment, cinemas Romania gone, audience whatsoever us. focused directly making films would important history cinema, present. felt way made film important story wanted tell.
think movement evolved quite well. It’s brought filmmakers focus really point view cinema something say. But, like wave, time passes, even novel style gets old becomes sort norm. doesn’t surprise anybody longer. it’s important authors reinvent find something fresh new say terms topic matter, also terms style. That’s fate waves, comes wave goes wave. know, there’ll another wave coming, even if, right now, it’s clear come from.
filmmakers, individuals, survived. perceived wave emerged time, pretty much age, first group filmmakers expressing fall communism Romania. now, many years later, see voices strong enough continue telling something.
That’s difficult thing cinema. It’s difficult make film surprise people once. make next film, eventually, build kind personal take cinema, complicated. think Corneliu telling point — checked —and, apparently, statistically, directors make two three films entire lives. you’ve managed make two three films actually got noticed, that’s quite good.
thing good new generation Romanian filmmakers deliberately trying different possible [from New Wave]. normal.

idea R.M.N. come from?
came real story. real story quite close see film. little village area inhabited mostly Hungarians. And, you’d imagine, area inhabited minority, people would empathic towards another minority coming in. not. perspective, was: don’t anything people, poor region, made great sacrifice stay try grow community, preserve traditions, —the owner bakery —have broken rules bringing foreigners community.
One reasons people behaved badly, course, color skin. But, it’s also true scandal emerged Romania, wave sympathy people overwhelming. People factory owners wrote said: We’ll hire them, we’ll take communities, work here.
thought story film very, relevant state world today. Even happens Transylvania Romania, feeling speaks way behave today hot issues xenophobia, truth. Ultimately, it’s film huge distance think say.
presented film Cannes last year lot places many people came said: could happened country, us well. It’s people don’t dare longer speak issues public. important see still enough freedom cinema, speak elephant room, sense know lot people think like this, behave don’t exist. Unless manage tackle issues directly, there’s way hoping cure them. can’t start hoping cure public attitude name willing talk it, understand happening.
empathetic way portraying characters film, even ones spout horrible, racist, xenophobic views.
important conflict film, me, internal conflict, external one, conflict good part us, feels empathy others, instinctual animalistic part us, makes us consider others potential enemies come steal world, food, horse whatever. That’s fight need try win. winning it, need talk it, expose it, see much comes instinct karma, much contextual.
One important step listen people displeased happening today. Migration today doesn’t look like 1,000 years ago, bunch people horseback would ride hill. come plane try get work. many people, feeling same: somebody doesn’t belong. It’s consequence globalization. many people living tiny, traditional communities feel: didn’t ask globalization, pay personally decisions say in. speed change great them. need time. think need patience talk , understand think like this, branding sinners, xenophobic, whatever.
particular case, villagers not, minds, xenophobic foreigners. thought alright xenophobic agains local Romani. trying protect community from.
thought story worth telling, see wrong. And, people don’t say this, nobody really wants live community next Romani population. Cannes screened film 30 different villages region, small towns, people agreed, principle, it’s good tolerant. things get scaled personally, everyone would prefer live street Romani people. There’s big gap principles agree on, really happens. It’s important engage conversation see stereotypes coming from.
also point hypocrisy ostensibly “good” people like factory owner, kind foreigners, also, way, exploiting labor.
Well, think there’s tendency, particularly cinema, oversimplify things. There’s tendency thinking filmmakers include position, citizens, films make. precisely think shouldn’t doing. position citizen issue film. think films bring forward issues important society moment. also think filmmakers abstain pushing views you. effort try understand things happen way do, people act way act, respect integrity truth reality, every way possible. Also formally, make huge effort shooting without cutting. also ethically, idea whoever are, don’t want judge, want bring forward people’s arguments.
it’s true end, there’s lot hypocrisy, even way film discussed. I’d two kinds Q&As: official ones stage talking people, conversations I’d left cinema, people would talk personally. Suddenly, started really saying think.
see hypocrisy us. France Italy, see effects hypocrisy, populists exploiting benefit. There’s point trying ignore people think claiming shouldn’t thinking like that. problem going solved way.
That’s end big surprises people vote. populist parties extreme right successful, people go: “Oh God, possible?” It’s possible haven’t listened people, haven’t engaged real conversation. conversation starts listen person. explaining arguments valid, need listen him. prevent talking, make kinds rules, telling “Shut up, politically incorrect, can’t say that,” won’t change thinks. moment freedom express himself, vote accordingly.
don’t think film polemic, conversation started polemic. be, cinema do.
seems many people view art expression personal opinions views artist. become challenging say: work, it’s opinion?
choose present reality objectively can. position artist. I’m following trend saying personal view opinion matters.
think it’s important bring forward issues, personal stories, opinion, take stand. That’s Matthias understands, end film, can’t stay neutral, take side. responsible even try avoid situation. personal responsibility. filmmaker, I’m trying signal spectator: responsibility. can’t say: don’t agree filmmaker, don’t view. issue is: position? dare position express public?
kind personal, critical judgment, difficult people develop today, Internet, fake news, avalanche information makes hard understand, hard listen, hard question yourself, think: would do?
often, people used saying “correct” thing, won’t even acknowledge, public, really think. It’s kind schizophrenia. response got many people: big difference people say publicly, think, privately. think it’s interesting cinema bring forward people really believe, show say privately there’s nobody around. that’s truth.
different making R.M.N., then, stylistically, compared 4 Months, 3 Weeks, 2 Days?
way I’ve told film isn’t different. style hasn’t changed much. principle use 4 Months, one shot per scene, still same. lot scenes shorter, film isn’t composed long moments. then, really wanted respect style, also longest scene I’ve ever shot film, 17-18 minutes without cut. also different think I’ve become master style, try make sure style isn’t visible. I’m trying make sure style doesn’t distract really watching story. finally, matters impact story spectator. I’ve tried shoot smooth way —every shot leads next —so people don’t notice film made.

compose incredible, 17-minute scene, town hall meeting, two women, factory owner, manager, arguing favor migrants, villagers getting aggressive towards them?
case, easy me. long shot end film almost replica, reenactment, real town hall meeting. It’s Internet. scandal started. people small village thought private conversation somebody filmed posted Internet day. And, sudden, access people saying actually thought private, public. translated —because Hungarian —but didn’t need invent much. watch, notice understand. important present people’s arguments, point view, directly. There’s something lot cinema today, really, dislike, kind politically-correct agenda. this, mean filmmakers ages talking important issues day, diversity say, sure everything presented “right” way, positive stance tackle issues. goes idea creativity.
course, films done too, me, artistic freedom means expressing things personal way. can’t one point view, one political perspective. million points view brought forward art. come country censorship strong. Today, it’s difficult speak censorship, think kind positive discrimination, positive discrimination ethically-important issues. positive discrimination comes bodies finance films, comes personal consciences filmmakers themselves. Everyone begins agree stories told told. is, view, cinema be. Cinema needs creative fresh. needs diversity points view. strength bear political incorrectness people disagree with, strength listen kinds points view. That’s art’s true strength resides.
scene town hall expresses this. townspeople coming church. start walking towards town hall. end, marching lockstep. marching marks transformation individual position opinion, part group conforming what’s safe think socially given moment. That’s characters two women important. represent need talking point view, even everybody else.
