Laura Linney Jessica Hecht Find Depth Small Scale Summer, 1976
key pleasure Summer, 1976 comes listening Laura Linney Jessica Hecht talk. two — haven’t worked alongside before? — distinct instruments know deploy well. Linney’s got assertive alto, Hecht’s timbre reedier winding, viola oboe. I’d happily see take number double-act parts (Hecht’s Glinda Linney’s Elphaba?), David Auburn’s gentle wise play, they’ve found piece finely wrought chamber music duet precision.
scale production kept purposefully small, painting miniature: Auburn introduces us Diana (Linney) Alice (Hecht) trade monologues, looking back around 2003 summer Columbus, Ohio, became friends young mothers. Diana wealthier uptight, single-mother art professor studio refuses let kids play in, Alice “sleepy-eyed little hippie” (according Diana) bit stoner who’s married young economist Ohio State. Auburn sets oil-and-water dynamic, circumstances — needing babysit — emulsify together. daughters become friends right away, bond slowly. Diana turns sexually liberated, happily encouraging Alice pursue flirtation grad student painting house, Alice reveals trepidatious. They’re shocking things learn another person, register deeply, writing eye level characters. Auburn hands Hecht line she, one best tosser-offers asides, lands grace: “I mean, obvious now, seemed like big revelation time, young — people aren’t one thing.” That’s no, duh that, treated consideration, also true.
spell Summer, 1976 casts depends Linney Hecht’s tuning audience play’s quietly rueful frequency. could imagine things jelling you’re right mind-set receive it, performances locked in. Linney predictably good part plays toward type favors, put-together woman fraying edges. She’s made regular appearances Samuel J. Friedman Theatre last decade giving type performance (to varying degreesof success). Here, draws humor, well Diana’s libido, undercuts certainty. She’s someone firm assertions youth, bound proven wrong due time, lovable snob who, fun bit period detail, can’t stand Alice reading something middlebrow Shōgun. Hecht may less name (I’m sorry didn’t cackle glee showed briefly Succession), Alice turns richer role. initially seems space cadet, often looking chance light joint tune Diana, soon learn getting married young stunted academic career (she’s read sorts serious novels, prefers beach reads) left aimless. Linney steps play Alice’s husband, donning oblivious growl self-serious professor, scenes two talk marriage, allowing see dynamic clearly stopped working. Alice, Hecht always shrugging, communicating lot gestures — mugging toward audience say, “Isn’t bullshit?” trying convince resignation. She’s placidly easy-breezy, realize, defense mechanism.
scenes Alice husband also let Hecht Linney ping-pong other, don’t get enough monologuing separately. Daniel Sullivan, directing, situates either side table trade speeches, early lulls rhythm that’s bit predictable. Things lively whenever one women interrupts contradicts other’s monologue, slip scene describe it, trip furniture warehouse Diana buys Alice desk. (Yes, sort play buying desk crucial plot development.) know, early on, two grown apart, Auburn wisely resists ratcheting things higher less naturalistic tenor drama. reveal that’s entirely unexpected comes near end, alongside jump present, play strains gets bigger woozier. We’re treated, briefly, swell twinkling music (by Greg Pliska) projections John Lee Beatty’s a-little-too-garish-1970s set. never goes course. Auburn brings action back around small yet big matter losing friendship.
scale Summer, 1976 makes easy dismiss. I’d joked friend it’s almost like Linney Hecht decided play backyard, realizing bunch Manhattan Theatre Club subscribers watching. wonder play would better fit smaller house — it’s recorded audiobook, too, probably excel Linney Hecht close ears — midst run spring openings averse subtlety, watching something specific Broadway relief. (Even something centered great performance like Prima Facie amped 11.) Everything need big occasion. It’s enough Diana Alice seem like real people dense fully realized histories, played care thoughtful actors. don’t experience anything grandly triumphant devastating, play offers challenge sitting quietly, meeting level, considering big vantage.
