ever seen good farce? Noises Off(a decent movie, better play) maybe Importance Earnest immediately come mind. Traditionally first act mostly set up, learning characters, relationships, romantic partners, enemies. second act hilarious cacophony door slamming, mistaken identity, screaming, cussing out, and, generally, whole world falling apart everything destroyed.
Watching episode Vanderpump Rules, realized deep second act. It’s like spent past ten years background understand complex relationships, watch crumble real time entertainment. (Based previews next week, think we’re getting started.)
culminates Tower 12, now-cursed restaurant, entire cast — including total newbies like Ally; Lala’s new man, Los Don; Satchel, collection hair ties snarled together public-pool filter — lose fucking minds. It’s Schwartz James, Schwartz Lala, Lala Raquel, Scheana Lala, Raquel Katie, Sandoval Katie, Katie everyone berets, Ally James, James knowing use straw, Tom Sandoval truth going Raquel. we’re perfectly honest, broke brain. also came twice.
Then, add Sandoval all, gourd isn’t big enough. episode starts, essentially, Schwartz telling Sandoval isn’t attracted Raquel, thinks crush someone else. “Yeah?” Sandoval says bagel-eating grin order called drop conversation. knew hooking Raquel time. Well, least made out. Later episode, producer asks Sandoval point blank anything physical happened Raquel. Sandoval responds, “Nothing happened. Like nothing wouldn’t happen between, like, know, Katie.” Oh, Katie affair, masturbated together FaceTime, completely betrayed Ariana’s trust. Good know!
Sandoval defends Raquel every opportunity whole episode, didn’t know know now, would like, “Good defending her.” mean, Scheana literally said would trust husband bed Raquel. wonder Scheana hit found news (mostly knew lost feud Katie fr fr).
whole episode makes question plans production Tom (and, lesser extent, Raquel). know original season trailer, came January 9, two months Scandoval broke, season would include “open relationship” stuff saw episode. interviews given fact, also know Sandoval considering breaking Ariana around time said didn’t dog’s grandmother’s deaths, happened episode. already looking escape hatch saying Schwartz “working love” Ariana. Siri, insert billion vomit emoji.
would season looked like affair never came light? Would debating whether boning? feel like, based season edited inherent biases particular cast mates, would recaps saying, “There’s way they’re fucking. Katie Lala mean they’re making whole thing up.” never knew, would reunion Raquel denying, denying, denying, like Kristen Jax them?
Also, Tom’s plan here? hold onto Ariana season ended (or reunion filmed) break slowly, slowly, slowly start drifting toward Raquel public boning whole time Valley Village love nest? already much relationship season, would ever gotten away it? It’s almost confounding going fertility clinic saying, “I’m jizz results.”
storyline kicks Ally, whose hatred James gone bubbling surface Zoomba class light day, tells James told Katie seeing Sandoval Raquel Abbey, Katie said, “They don’t many rules.” James interprets open relationship. wouldn’t know this? aren’t Housewives met seasons ago. group friends decade hang off-season. two shagging side, everyone would secret. Ally, novice, thinks talk Ariana it. James, who, many faults, knows play reality TV, tells speak Scheana mostly loves gossip eat up.
Lala James meet “drinks,” James decides, quite sweetly, invite everyone whole group hang beach. says used uninvited things always hurt, doesn’t want dude. Aw. James knows reality television arts sciences, knows doesn’t invite Raquel, everyone want talk didn’t invite her.
really good idea, though? Isn’t setup farce? Ally says, “In friend group, it’s normal see ex. Usually, break never see again. friend group, you’re looking around, you’re like it’s nothing exes.” Isn’t whole conundrum show point?
Ally lunch Scheana, go according plan. Sche-Shay freaks Katie saying open relationship thing, mostly Scheana hates Katie wants everyone think she’s spreading vicious rumors Raquel Tom absent Ariana. Scheana, upon hearing Abbey rumor, also says “Brock like big brother Raquel, like Sandoval big brother her.” Scheana ends conversation saying going make beeline Sandoval beach tell this. Oops. Sorry, Ally. You’re still novice.
True word, Scheana tells Sandoval right away, doesn’t blow open. Why? Well, probably Tom knows Raquel bumping uglies Ariana town doesn’t want draw attention it. best part conversation, though, Sandoval says open relationship, would want Brock come “hang out.” Scheana says, “I’d love Ariana make-out sesh.” Even knew Raquel, Scheana thought gross hook with, even imagined swinger scenario.
reason doesn’t come DJ James Kennedy, white Kanye himself, makes giant scene. Alright, alright, fault mostly Tom Schwartz. James tells gig Imagine Fest Atlanta, Schwartz says, “That’s huge. bigger Rachella?” referencing James proposed Raquel last year. James makes immediately clear bad joke, Sandoval recognizes well. James, poor unfortunate soul, can’t handle anger says, “Make another unfunny joke,” throws drink Schwartz’s face.
James’s tragic flaw can’t handle anger. would totally justified Schwartz made awful joke James immediately threw drink. totally sympathize says wants people happy change, totally undermines can’t handle bad joke. Oh, James. crowd ever big enough, approval ever suffice, amount hot girlfriends make hugs monstrous parents never gave you. But, Charli says, “You can’t throw drinks people. It’s nice.”
this, Katie Lala take men find bar leave mess behind. text Kristina Kelly (Always what? Yeah, know now.) come meet bar. tells group, next thing know, everyone sitting around sad living room-like lounge alcohol guts blood minds.
Schwartz, asshole whole day, one good thing apologizes James bad joke. Lala walks join conversation says James owes punch face making Raquel. wakes sleeping giant Tom Lala’s feud hung Randall. two start insulting quite loudly public place.
friend group knows well everything say other, every insult, every read, absolutely correct. Lala Schwartz:
“I see right basset hound shit …”
“Open bar I’ll impressed …”
“Call business.”
“You’re broke, you’re 40 years old. Look …”
“The stuff I’ve last year would put grave.”
single lie detected. Schwartz Lala:
“You personification sponsored post. corniest human entire place. Give Lala. Lala?”
“Go get Botox plastic surgery. don’t know …”
“You’re angry you’re bitter. don’t want know you. You’re bootleg housewife. Look lips. Ugh.”
Again, single lie detected. side fight two awful people call awfulness other. take one mediocre-looking chicken wings chomp along fight.
one issue, however, Lala says business pays daughter, Tom says, “You’re good mother. You’re good mother,” laughs. Oh, shut way fucking up, Schwartz. I’m every insult kids (haha, “kids”) throw other, many lines like James all-you-can-eat pasta buffet. Lala tells Katie Tom line making fun face. Um, really? Lala takes every opportunity call Raquel stupid, joke fake lips far? Get onto next bus back Utah skullduggery nonsense. (Is skullduggery means? don’t know.)
think couldn’t get worse, James takes giant fishbowl cocktail offers Kristina Kelly drink liquid middle. Ally flicks straw sends liquid straight eye. James makes high-pitched squeal described “damsel top chair seeing mouse” “fart too-tight bumhole.” Sandoval tells 115-proof alcohol wash out. James runs toilet, tripping way whimpering washes eye.
waitress comes tells water, nothing worry about. “I’m pussy,” James says. “I heard laughing calling you.” Oh, James — you’re scared little boy, that’s okay. I’m telling it’s okay. Yes, could still beat Schwartz fight, don’t worry soft needing help. Ally best counter James behavior whole day. Ally shouts him, “No one wants see make fool yourself. one enjoying … sit shut up.” room, space, horrible dark day beach, Ally correct. However, context show, want see make fool entertainment. want see make fools themselves. Why? it’s farce, would hilarious heart didn’t break 19 different ways.
