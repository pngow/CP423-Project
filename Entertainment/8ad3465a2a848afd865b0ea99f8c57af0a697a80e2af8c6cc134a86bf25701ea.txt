National Want Taylor Swift Duet ‘The Alcott’ Played ‘in Context’
Picture going back ten years telling someone National Taylor Swift would make song together. Even recently band’s last album, 2019’s guest-heavy Easy Find, pairing might come shock. National announced latest collection, First Two Pages Frankenstein: opener featuring old pal sometimes collaborator Sufjan Stevens, two tracks featuring Phoebe Bridgers, “The Alcott” Swift. matter else happened group’s long-awaited comeback, song would event.
“The Alcott” began sparse piano track Aaron Dessner gave front man Matt Berninger. Berninger wrote vocal, Dessner thought sending friend folklore collaborator. anxiously waited 20 minutes reply, thinking might put position would turn down. Instead, sent voice note fully formed contribution — vocals wrapped around Berninger’s new lyrics changing angle song. band built arrangement finished there.
“The Alcott” one beautiful moments First Two Pages Frankenstein, also feels like rupture reality. like past National features, might strain hear (quite notable) names Sharon Van Etten somewhere layers song. Swift’s voice enters, it’s unmistakable far buried mix. Initially, follows Berninger’s existing melody, get chorus, swoops around him. starts National song end (almost) sounds like Swift’s still cohering proper duet.
Ahead First Two Pages Frankenstein’s arrival, called Dessner talk song came work Swift impacted National.
finished song sent Taylor? much rearranging happened contributed part? late stage making First Two Pages Frankenstein. much music working on. were, like, 25 ideas. honest, wasn’t kind song intended write record. making lot things — up-tempo loud rock songs. version Leonard Cohen Nick Cave song. Matt wrote beautiful song it, suddenly felt like might one could share Taylor.
hadn’t even talked inviting record, partially one record point and, also, never want put pressure anybody unless really makes sense. something song thought she’d really respond to. quickly rewrote conversation dialogue two lovers. helped shape went production it. added lot elements — orchestration drums. always experiment try lot things. think first heard it, piano Matt.
gone studio thinking asking contribute something? We’ve collaborating consistently sincefolklore think it’s natural. loves National heard lot working on. I’d send her. wasn’t openly saying, “I’d love could something,” wasn’t saying either. It’d depend song. sent her, talked Matt, agreed might one see ideas.
There’s long history National opening people benefiting it. Back even beginning band, there’s always people influence us help solve riddles. like that. You’re lucky happen friend one greatest songwriters ever — fast.
National strangers collaborations. often perceive one texture dense arrangements. Easy Find, went direction, songs Matt ceded lead-vocal duties entirely. strikes first: straight-up duet Taylor’s touch prominent. There’s clarity ideation lyricism sense melody. cuts like knife. Compositionally, it’s intentional. countermelodies chorus bridge — it’s like two lovers almost talking other. It’s something that’s much bolder someone singing along harmonizing. gift: storyteller’s mind musical sense boldness.
Something phrasing … hear even original voice note. She’s coloring in; she’s fully another character story. makes sense. verse, Matt talking finding someone they’re writing golden notebook. way, like, Taylor? it? fictional character? inhabits story character. makes true feature.
first time sang together — “coney island” evermore. sang song band, Big Red Machine, 2021. bringing National’s world different collaborations? nervous? wouldn’t say nervous. feel like National dysfunctional band brothers, feel like Taylor’s work much focused. Big Red Machine typical band dynamic. another way, whole reason know Taylor National fan. felt natural. think we’re one favorite bands, inspired us.
first time you’re National album folklore evermore. spent time world, experience change ambition National? make think else might possible band? went away long time. work. really amazing experience learned much. think, coming back National, feeling everyone leaning different way, missing also appreciating other. difficult time pandemic. find thread … Taylor said this. Around time working, asking National saying, “I don’t know are.” kind predicted we’d come back lean make best record.
That’s, me, feels. DNA band, future version it, evolution — it’s there. People always debate records. matter what, collections ugly ducklings. We’re never going write perfect rock song. We’re never going thing set do. uncovering awkward songs. grow us grow people. takes hear them, that’s makes special. feel sculptural eventually, first it, it’s like, even good band? [Laughs.] feel really proud it, feel like benefit things learned [with people], also think well filled lot creative energy.
think song one striking, exciting moments album, also seems like potential quite divisive within fan base. ever conversation — whether might much record stand-alone single something instead? beginning National, ’90s-era indie bands idolized … can’t imagine Pavement somebody back collaborating across pop sphere. think that’s changed radically. Like Taylor, she’s hands-on craft oriented anyone I’ve ever met. never felt like major-label superstar. Working unlike working indie artist. actual fact, she’s one biggest artists world, connections musical chemistry organically make work make make sense. Yeah, it’s great think fans might hear band. know lot fans fell love music.
I’m personally tired feeling, indie alternative — doesn’t mean anything anymore. lot favorite music giant labels. indie labels operate like major labels now. It’s blurry thing. someone’s making something authentic amazing artist, would appreciate collaborate regardless genre walls. know certain parts fan base maybe … it’s thing records: It’s never going everybody wants. interest that. honestly, kind bugs us sometimes. Nobody’s resistant guests, think sometimes people would love we’d make exactly kind record want hear. kind record make five us manage create feel compelling.
took us little figure interview out. seemed bit aversion focusing Taylor song. curious — concern preserving mystery ahead release? worry could overshadow rest album? You’ve set comeback era, talking First Two Pages “ultimate” National album. Taylor Swift duet pretty loud headline. sense like … far biggest artist that’s part record. It’s important allow record hear song context. course careful let leak. It’s reality life; people constantly try get one way another. shred information catnip media. glare quite intense, friend, try really sensitive much, ways, shine light. song, made sense let part whole record rather pulling like, “Here’s Taylor song.”
mentioned abundance music, including rock-oriented songs. guys also talked releasing double record one point, tailoring incarnation. There’s least another record’s worth album-quality songs. good anything record. something material. hear bits it, like “Eucalyptus” “Grease Hair.” think it’s going rock, somebody say something, reality it’ll quite different. It’ll go different emotional place. sound like ourselves, know mean?
