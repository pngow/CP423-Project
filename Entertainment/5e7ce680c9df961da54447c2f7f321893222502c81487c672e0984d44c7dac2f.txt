post-Golden Age TV anti-heroes, it’s hardly surprising protagonist faces consequences actions, especially show airs Home Box Office. Perry Mason, iconic defense attorney played Matthew Rys hero truest sense. Though sassy antagonistic, well-meaning Mason always sticks marginalized helpless, even every character show’s Depression-era Los Angeles would describe absolute worst: drunken murderer sympathizer.
Despite hard edge, Perry big softie whatever takes get best deal clients. season two, representing two young Mexican brothers charged murder prominent oil heir, “whatever takes” gets lawyer locked up: final moments finale, Perry walks prison serve four-month sentence concealing murder weapon office safe, crime willing commit ensure fair trial client. perhaps first time entire series, Perry Mason peace. “There pride it,” Rhys says Perry’s decision. “It’s like, something needed do, therefore I’ll serve time. qualms certainly shame.”
season finale opens characters learning big twist case: Camille (Hope Davis) mastermind behind McCutcheon’s murder; coordinated paid he’d get way. comes real twist: Perry going prison four months. producer star, feel pressure execute reveals show relies them? don’t feel pressure. apply pressure writers say, Well, everyone’s going expecting big, juicy stuff, bring it. could gone different ways, toying different ending.
It’s much pressure landing shows, wouldn’t wish anyone. build much people like, Okay, want tie-ups, also want twists. deliver much. It’s anticipation point view — it’s deliver it. expectation us like, Okay, hope bring juice.
toying different ending, first presented idea Perry going jail? halfway shooting season. saying, “What Mason something ultimately helps case serves justice, pay price?” classic Mason: “I whatever takes right person get punished right person get off.” means always dubious, strong sense right wrong. He’s like, “I happily tell son I’m prison right thing, therefore conscience clear. something that’s ultimately seen eyes law that’s wrong, got one innocent man man crime serving time.”
motivates Perry go extremes? really tacked onto experience First World War. first season he’s presented excruciating moment three heavily injured men can’t escape inevitably executed Germans die slowly. takes upon shoot head order expedite less painful death. tried military court comes worst it. lives life according thing: There’s right wrong everything else middle gets trouble. heart, sees things black white. sense justice basic, means wherein lie complexities.
Perry also quite modern thinker era. He’s overtly racist. sees women beyond expected roles time. conscious decision. you’ve rock bottom, judgment others won’t necessarily extreme objective. empathy humanity opened result wronged enormously. whole backstory gave family farm went through, pioneer families mothers incredibly strong. He’s seen absolute worst nothing’s going phase him. It’ll enrage him, shock comes people lie.
Earlier season, Perry learns brothers directly connected murder weapon, he’s really upset. visits brothers prison screams them. quickly moves still willing fight them. Yes, understands did. empathy. understanding human condition astute.
courtroom scenes finale throughout season well executed: They’re theatrical every scene feels like it’s moving story forward. logistics compare shooting scenes? logistics nightmare everyone reaction, take long. takes lot you. find hard, way, pitch sometimes. remind myself, Well, Mason still new this. He’s experienced trial lawyer stretch imagination. It’s real luxury actor.
closing argument finale, Perry explains jury bias justice illusion. seems like difficult dialogue deliver could easily come across preachy angry. decide play that? That’s Mason. He’s unsentimental, he’s good trial lawyer. He’s theatrics, he’s dramatic, he’s matter fact. boils ethos, is, you’re presented what’s true, don’t imbue anything. intelligent person able see what’s right what’s wrong. That’s works from. I’ve never tried theatrical don’t think that’s is.
talk scene Japanese restaurant? much appreciated food acting scene. Shea Whigham’s unparalleled commitment eating onscreen rub you? come school thought. tired watching people nibble piece cucumber. It’s pet peeve one eats properly. commit it. remember scene Americans Noah Emmerich eating pizza. You’ve got eat people go, “God, want piece pizza now.”
scene reason took hours hours hours. ate much beef meat sweats. like, Whoa, must getting old one’s getting me.
really enjoyed arc Perry Strickland season, even though painful see fight. like filming fight scene penultimate episode? meant messy, stupid fight two people love hate moment. meant whiff great choreography execution; meant mess was. written Shea throws afterward. loved it.
little vomit really funny. that’s be. hot. Shea smoke smoke smoke. smoked many cigarettes fight, fight again, fight two us like, “This pleasant 95-degree weather.”
Season two took bit pivot first season lightened tone. Perry sassy. strike balance performance? rely heavily writing. Showrunners Jack Amiel Michael Begler said beginning season two, “Look, don’t want take away anything season one, want open bit lighter season.” worry me! can’t turn people heads sudden there’s comedic element. struck tone perfectly. It’s heavily sardonic, sarcastic humor — caustic almost. It’s gallows humor gets Mason darker hours. glad tack went kind way.
think Perry might change four months prison? don’t know that’s beauty it. love fact didn’t start season two comfortable lawyer going, “Yeah, let’s take another case!” crumbly. Four months prison going affect much find beginning season three, if, God willing, one.
