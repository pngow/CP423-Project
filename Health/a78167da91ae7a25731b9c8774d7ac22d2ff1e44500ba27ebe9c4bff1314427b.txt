Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) Test?
AFP test test mainly used measure level alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) blood pregnant person. test checks baby's risk certain genetic problems birth defects. AFP test usually done 15 20 weeks pregnancy.
AFP protein developing baby makes. Normally, AFP passes baby pregnant person's blood. Certain conditions make baby's body release less AFP. pregnancy, AFP blood levels higher lower normal, may sign that:
baby high risk genetic disorder, as:
neural tube defect, serious condition causes abnormal development developing baby's brain and/or spine.
syndrome, genetic disorder causes intellectual disabilities health problems.
estimated due date wrong. AFP levels normally rise fall set times pregnancy, abnormal AFP may mean baby due earlier later estimated. common reason abnormal AFP levels.
pregnant one baby. baby makes AFP, AFP blood levels higher two babies.
names: AFP Maternal; Maternal Serum AFP; msAFP screen
used for?
AFP blood test used pregnancy check baby's risk birth defects genetic disorders, neural tube defects syndrome. test diagnose health conditions. AFP test results normal, means need testing find whether baby health problem.
people pregnant, AFP test may used help diagnose certain cancers may cause high AFP levels adults. test used way, called AFP tumor marker test.
need AFP test?
pregnant, AFP test routinely offered 15th 20th week pregnancy. provider may especially recommend test you:
happens AFP test?
health care professional take blood sample vein arm, using small needle. needle inserted, small amount blood collected test tube vial. may feel little sting needle goes out. usually takes less five minutes.
need anything prepare test?
need special preparation AFP test.
risks test?
little risk baby AFP blood test. may slight pain bruising spot needle put in, symptoms go away quickly.
results mean?
common cause abnormal AFP test results pregnancy error estimating due date. result normal may also sign possible problems:
Lower normal AFP levels may mean baby genetic disorder syndrome, genetic disorder causes intellectual disabilities health problems.
Higher normal AFP levels may mean baby increased risk neural tube defect, as:
Spina bifida, condition bones spine close around part spinal cord
anything else need know AFP test?
AFP tests often part group prenatal tests called multiple marker triple screen tests. tests help diagnose syndrome, trisomy 18 (Edwards syndrome), genetic disorders. triple screen test includes tests for:
Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)
Human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG), hormone produced placenta
cases, fourth test included, called inhibin test, helps diagnose syndrome.
high risk baby certain birth defects, provider may also recommend test called prenatal cell-free DNA (cfDNA) screening. blood test done early 10th week pregnancy. show baby higher chance syndrome certain genetic disorders.
