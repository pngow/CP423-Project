Anion Gap Blood Test?
anion gap blood test way check acid-base balance (pH balance) blood. tells blood acidic acidic enough. test uses results another blood test called electrolyte panel. Electrolytes electrically charged minerals body, sodium, potassium, bicarbonate. help control acid-base balance blood.
electrolytes positive electric charge. Others negative electric charge. anion gap measures difference—or gap—between negatively charged positively charged electrolytes blood. anion gap high, blood acidic normal. anion gap low, blood acidic enough. high low results may signs serious disorder body needs attention.
names: Serum anion gap
used for?
anion gap blood test shows whether electrolytes balance blood acidic acidic enough. much acid blood called acidosis. little acid blood called alkalosis. conditions serious.
need anion gap blood test?
health care provider may order anion gap blood test symptoms blood acidity may normal. symptoms may include:
happens anion gap blood test?
anion gap test calculation that's done results electrolyte panel, blood test.
blood test, health care professional take blood sample vein arm, using small needle. needle inserted, small amount blood collected test tube. may feel little sting needle goes out. usually takes less five minutes.
need anything prepare test?
special preparation necessary anion gap blood test. provider ordered tests blood sample, may need fast (not eat drink) several hours test. provider let know special instructions follow.
risks test?
little risk test. may feel slight pain bruising spot needle put in, symptoms go away quickly.
results mean?
Several types medical conditions cause abnormal anion gap test results. provider use results anion gap test, medical history, tests make diagnosis.
high anion gap test result may mean may acidosis (blood acidic normal). Acidosis may caused by:
low anion gap test result may mean alkalosis (blood less acidic normal). result rare provider usually tested make sure results accurate.
common cause low anion gap low level albumin, protein blood. Low albumin may sign eating enough protein, kidney problems, liver disease, heart disease, types cancer.
anything else need know anion gap blood test?
anion gap blood test provides information acid-base balance blood. tells health many body functions. wide range normal results many possible causes abnormal results. So, talk provider test results mean whether need additional testing make diagnosis.
