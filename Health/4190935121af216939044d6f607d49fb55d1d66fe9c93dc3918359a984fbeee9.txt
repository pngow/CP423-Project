different types MEN 2 often cause tumors certain glands make hormones, including thyroid. types MEN 2 increase risk medullary thyroid cancer. MEN 2 caused changes gene called RET. Changes genes also called gene variants mutations.
inherit MEN 2 - increased risk medullary thyroid cancer - either parents passed changed RET gene you. MEN 2 runs family, regular calcitonin tests help find cancer early may easier treat.
need calcitonin test?
may need calcitonin test help check medullary thyroid cancer C-cell hyperplasia if:
family history MEN 2, increases risk developing medullary thyroid cancer. MEN 2 runs family, family members, including children, may need regular calcitonin tests help find cancer symptoms. provider may also suggest blood test check changes RET genes cause MEN 2.
happens calcitonin test?

little risk blood test. may slight pain bruising spot needle put in, symptoms go away quickly.
results mean?
meaning calcitonin test results depends reason tested. calcitonin test:
help diagnose screen medullary thyroid cancer C-cell hyperplasia:
normal calcitonin level may mean either condition, rule out. That's medullary thyroid cancer C-cell hyperplasia always cause high calcitonin. provider may order tests learn more.
high calcitonin level means C cells thyroid making much calcitonin. higher level, likely medullary thyroid cancer C-cell hyperplasia. high calcitonin levels may caused conditions, including certain cancers, certain medicines, pregnancy. make diagnosis, provider consider information, including test results.
low calcitonin level known medical problem.
monitor treatment medullary thyroid cancer check whether cancer come back treatment: meaning test results depends type treatment had. Treatment usually starts surgery remove thyroid gland. treatments include radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and/or medicines.
general:
