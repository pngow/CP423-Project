anti-müllerian hormone (AMH) test?
anti-müllerian hormone (AMH) test measures amount AMH blood sample. males, AMH made testicles (or testes), glands make sperm male hormones. females, ovaries make AMH. ovaries glands eggs form female hormones made.
AMH plays different roles males females normal levels AMH vary sex age. Measuring AMH levels provide information variety reproductive health conditions.
unborn babies, AMH helps form male female reproductive organs. sex unborn babies set chromosomes inherit parents. Male babies XY chromosomes female babies XX chromosomes. development reproductive organs genitals affected hormones, including AMH.
early weeks pregnancy, male female babies set ducts (tubes) called Müllerian ducts. Normally, male babies make high levels AMH testicular tissue. AMH makes Müllerian ducts shrink helps male organs grow. AMH levels stay high male children puberty begin decrease.
Unborn female babies low levels AMH. allows Müllerian ducts develop uterus, fallopian tubes, upper part vagina. AMH stays low female children. puberty, follicles inside ovaries begin make AMH. Follicles small sacs ovaries hold immature eggs.
healthy females childbearing age, higher levels AMH mean ovaries larger supply eggs. females age, number eggs decreases, causes AMH levels decrease. menopause, eggs left, AMH levels drop zero.
used for?
AMH tests mainly used tests make decisions treating female infertility (not able get pregnant). infertility treatment, AMH testing can:
Check many eggs left ovaries. called "ovarian reserve." normal ovarian reserve decrease age. AMH test tell size ovarian reserve, can't tell health eggs predict whether able get pregnant.
Predict well may respond fertility medicine. Normally, ovaries prepare one egg fertilization month. using vitro fertilization (IVF) baby, health care provider prescribe fertility medicine make ovaries prepare many eggs time. eggs removed mixed sperm make embryos outside body. embryos either frozen put uterus start pregnancy.
Testing AMH level helps provider know dose fertility medicine may need get best response.
females, AMH testing may also used to:
Find getting close menopause already begun menopause. approach menopause egg supply shrinks AMH levels drop. AMH levels used check premature menopause (before age 40) early menopause (before age 45). AMH test can't predict actually reach menopause. average age menopause 52.
Help diagnose monitor problems ovaries cause high AMH levels. include:
check healthy testicles male baby child may undescended testicles. condition testicles fail move belly, develop birth, proper place scrotum. Healthy testicles male baby produce AMH. So, normal AMH levels mean baby healthy, working testicles, dropped scrotum. Little AMH sign conditions need testing.
learn baby born genitals clearly male female. condition called "atypical genitalia." past, called "ambiguous genitalia" "intersex." many types atypical genitalia different causes. example, problems AMH hormones male baby lead development internal female reproductive organs external genitals look typical.
AMH test show whether baby working testicular tissue. information help diagnose cause problem. test usually done tests, including chromosome testing, hormone tests, ultrasound scans check sex organs glands inside body.
need AMH test?
female, may need AMH test you:
fertility problems. may need AMH test to:
Find egg supply normal age.
Plan vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment. Higher levels AMH mean likely respond fertility medicine may need small dose. Low levels AMH may mean need higher doses respond.
treated certain types ovarian cancer. AMH testing show treatment working. treatment test show whether cancer returned.
male baby child testicles scrotum may need AMH test help find healthy testicles inside body.
baby genitals clearly male female may need AMH test along tests help diagnose cause disorder confirm sex.
happens AMH test?
health care professional take blood sample vein arm, using small needle. needle inserted, small amount blood collected test tube vial. may feel little sting needle goes out. usually takes less five minutes.
need anything prepare test?
need special preparations AMH test.
risks test?
little risk blood test. may slight pain bruising spot needle put in, symptoms go away quickly.
results mean?
AMH test results mean depends reason test done:
healthy trying get pregnant, ask provider explain AMH test results mean fertility based age test results. general, high level AMH means eggs available, low level means egg supply shrinking time get pregnant may shorter.
tested polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), high level AMH sign may disease. AMH test alone cannot diagnose PCOS. cure PCOS, symptoms managed medications and/or lifestyle changes.
tested menopause, low AMH may mean getting close menopause. AMH test results can't predict long menopause. test result showed AMH blood, means menopause. younger age 40 symptoms menopause, AMH level that's lower average age may sign primary ovarian insufficiency.
treated ovarian cancer, decrease AMH usually mean treatment working. AMH increases, may mean treatment working cancer returned.
male baby child tested undescended testicles:
Normal AMH levels mean baby working testicles, right location. condition treated surgery and/or hormone therapy.
