electromyography (EMG) nerve conduction studies?
Electromyography (EMG) nerve conduction studies tests measure electrical activity muscles nerves. Nerves send electrical signals make muscles react certain ways. muscles react, give signals, measured.
EMG test looks electrical signals muscles make rest used.
nerve conduction study measures fast well body's electrical signals travel nerves.
EMG tests nerve conduction studies help find disorder muscles, nerves, both. tests done separately, usually done time.
used for?
EMG nerve conduction studies used help diagnose variety muscle nerve disorders. EMG test helps find muscles responding right way nerve signals. Nerve conduction studies help diagnose nerve damage disease. EMG tests nerve conduction studies done together, helps providers tell symptoms caused muscle disorder nerve problem.
need EMG test nerve conduction study?
may need tests symptoms muscle nerve disorder. symptoms include:
happens EMG test nerve conduction study?
provider place needle electrode muscle. needle electrode special wire mild electric current flows through. may slight pain discomfort electrode inserted.
machine record muscle activity muscle rest.
asked tighten (contract) muscle slowly steadily. machine record activity.
electrode may moved record activity different muscles.
electrical activity recorded shown video screen. activity displayed wavy spiky lines. activity may also recorded sent audio speaker. may hear popping sounds contract muscle.
nerve conduction study:
sit lie table bed.
provider attach one electrodes certain nerve nerves using tape paste. electrodes, called stimulating electrodes, deliver mild electrical pulse.
provider attach different types electrodes muscle muscles controlled nerves. electrodes record responses electrical stimulation nerve.
provider send small pulse electricity stimulating electrodes stimulate nerve send signal muscle.
may cause mild tingling feeling.
provider record time takes muscle respond nerve signal.
speed response called conduction velocity.
tests, nerve conduction study done first.
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known Lou Gehrig's disease. progressive, ultimately fatal, disorder attacks nerve cells brain spinal cord. affects muscles use move, speak, eat, breathe.
questions results, talk health care provider.
