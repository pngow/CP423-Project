bone density scan?
bone density scan, also known DEXA scan, type low-dose x-ray test measures calcium minerals bones. measurement helps show strength thickness (known bone density mass) bones.
people's bones become thinner get older. bones become thinner normal, known osteopenia. Osteopenia puts risk serious condition called osteoporosis. Osteoporosis progressive disease causes bones become thin brittle. Osteoporosis usually affects older people common women age 65. People osteoporosis higher risk fractures (broken bones), especially hips, spine, wrists.
used for?
need bone density scan?
women age 65 older bone density scan. Women age group high risk losing bone density, lead fractures. may also risk low bone density you:
happens bone density scan?
different ways measure bone density. common accurate way uses procedure called dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, also known DEXA scan. scan usually done radiologist's office.
DEXA scan:
lie back padded table. probably able leave clothes on.
may need lie legs straight, may asked rest legs padded platform.
scanning machine pass lower spine hip. time, another scanning machine called photon generator pass beneath you. images two machines combined sent computer. health care provider view images computer screen.
machines scanning, need stay still. may asked hold breath.
measure bone density forearm, finger, hand, foot, provider may use portable scanner known peripheral DEXA (p-DEXA) scan.
need anything prepare test?
may told stop taking calcium supplements 24 48 hours test. Also, avoid wearing metal jewelry clothes metal parts, buttons buckles.
risks test?
bone density scan uses low doses radiation. safe people. recommended pregnant woman. Even low doses radiation could harm unborn baby. sure tell provider pregnant think may pregnant.
results mean?
Bone density results often given form score. score measurement compares bone density measurement bone density healthy 30-year-old. low score means probably bone loss.
results may show one following:
score -1.0 higher. considered normal bone density.
score -1.0 -2.5. means low bone density (osteopenia) may risk developing osteoporosis.
score -2.5 less. means probably osteoporosis.
results show low bone density, health care provider recommend steps prevent bone loss. may include:
Getting exercise, activities walking, dancing, using weight machines.
Adding calcium vitamin diet
Taking prescription medicines increase bone density
questions results and/or treatments bone loss, talk health care provider.
anything else need know bone density scan?
DEXA scan common way measure bone density. health care provider may order tests confirm diagnosis find bone loss treatment working. include calcium blood test, vitamin test, and/or tests certain hormones.
