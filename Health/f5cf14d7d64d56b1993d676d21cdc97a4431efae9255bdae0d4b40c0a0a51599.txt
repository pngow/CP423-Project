CD4 count?
CD4 count blood test measures number CD4 cells sample blood. CD4 cells type white blood cell. They're also called CD4 lymphocytes "helper cells." That's help fight infection triggering immune system destroy viruses, bacteria, germs may make sick.
CD4 count mostly used check health immune system infected HIV (human immunodeficiency virus).
HIV attacks destroys CD4 cells. Without treatment, HIV may destroy many CD4 cells immune system trouble fighting infections. HIV virus causes AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). AIDS serious stage HIV infection. AIDS, CD4 count low may develop serious infections viruses, bacteria, fungi usually cause problems healthy people. called "opportunistic infections," become life-threatening. AIDS increases risk developing certain cancers, too.
people HIV AIDS. take HIV medicine prescribed, may never develop AIDS.
HIV, CD4 count help health care provider check risk serious infections. CD4 count may also used help diagnose monitor certain conditions affect immune system.
used for?
See HIV affecting immune system. CD4 counts help monitor risk developing opportunistic infections certain cancers. risk increases, provider may give treatment help prevent infections.
Help check well HIV treatment working. CD4 count used test called HIV viral load test see HIV medicines working. viral load tests measures much HIV blood.
Diagnose AIDS. Without treatment, HIV lead low CD4 count, means AIDS.
CD4 count may also used to:
Monitor treatment organ transplant. organ transplantation, need take medicine prevent immune system attacking new organ. medicines called "anti-rejection" drugs immunosuppressants. may also take medicines treat certain autoimmune diseases. low CD4 count means medicine working.
Help diagnose different types lymphoma. CD4 count may used tests find type immune cells causing lymphoma. test results help choose right treatment.

CD4 counts may change even health changed. So, provider usually look test results time see there's trend CD4 counts.
HIV, low CD4 count means HIV weakened immune system. CD4 count 200 fewer cells per cubic millimeter means AIDS. AIDS high risk developing life-threatening infections cancers.
HIV, low CD4 count may caused infection. Cancer chemotherapy medicines weaken immune system may also cause low CD4 counts. certain cases, cause low CD4 count unknown, uncommon.
High CD4 Count: Counts normal range may sign infection blood cancer.
cure HIV, different medicines take control virus protect immune system. fact, CD4 counts usually increase medicines, helps keep healthy. living HIV, important take medicine prescribed get regular blood tests, including CD4 counts.
