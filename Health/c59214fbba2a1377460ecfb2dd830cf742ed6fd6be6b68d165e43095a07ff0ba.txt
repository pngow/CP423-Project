Elastography
elastography?
elastography, also known liver elastography, type imaging test checks liver fibrosis. Fibrosis condition reduces blood flow inside liver. causes buildup scar tissue. Left untreated, fibrosis lead serious problems liver. include cirrhosis, liver cancer, liver failure. early diagnosis treatment reduce even reverse effects fibrosis.
two types liver elastography tests:
Ultrasound elastography, also known Fibroscan, brand name ultrasound device. test uses sound waves measure stiffness liver tissue. Stiffness sign fibrosis.
MRE (magnetic resonance elastography), test combines ultrasound technology magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI procedure uses powerful magnets radio waves create images organs structures inside body. MRE test, computer program creates visual map shows liver stiffness.
Elastography testing may used place liver biopsy, invasive test involves removing piece liver tissue testing.
used for?
elastography used diagnose fatty liver disease (FLD) fibrosis. FLD condition fat builds liver. fat lead cell death fibrosis.
need elastography?
Many people fibrosis symptoms. left untreated, fibrosis continue scar liver eventually turn cirrhosis.
Cirrhosis term used describe excessive scarring liver. Cirrhosis often caused alcohol abuse hepatitis. severe cases, cirrhosis life threatening. Cirrhosis cause symptoms. may need test symptoms cirrhosis another liver disease.
Symptoms cirrhosis liver diseases similar may include:
happens elastography?
lie examination table back, right abdominal area exposed.
radiology technician spread gel skin area.
place wand-like device, called transducer, area skin covers liver.
probe deliver series sound waves. waves travel liver bounce back. waves high pitched can't hear them.
may feel gentle flick done, hurt.
sound waves recorded, measured, displayed monitor.
measurement shows level stiffness liver.
procedure takes five minutes, entire appointment may take half hour so.
MRE (magnetic resonance elastography) done type machine many steps traditional MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) test. MRE procedure:
lie narrow examination table.
radiology technician place small pad abdomen. pad emit vibrations pass liver.
table slide MRI scanner, tunnel-shaped machine contains magnet. may given earplugs headphones test help block noise scanner, loud.
inside scanner, pad activate send measurements vibrations liver. measurements recorded onto computer turned visual map shows stiffness liver.
test takes 30 60 minutes.
need anything prepare test?
need special preparations ultrasound elastography. MRE, sure remove metal jewelry accessories test.
risks test?
known risks ultrasound elastography. little risk MRE people. people feel nervous claustrophobic inside scanner. feel way, may given medicine test help relax.
Also, MRE testing may good choice people metal devices implanted bodies. include pacemakers, artificial heart valves, infusion pumps. magnet MRI affect operation devices, cases, could dangerous. Dental braces certain types tattoos contain metal may also cause problems procedure.
test also recommended women pregnant think might pregnant. known whether magnetic fields harmful unborn babies.
results mean?
types elastography measure stiffness liver. stiffer liver, fibrosis have. results may range scarring mild, moderate, advanced liver scarring. Advanced scarring known cirrhosis. health care provider may order additional testing, including liver function blood tests liver biopsy, confirm diagnosis.
diagnosed mild moderate fibrosis, may able take steps stop scarring sometimes even improve condition. steps include:
