Learn cancer soon diagnosed. CEA levels help predict likelihood recovery and/or chance cancer come back treatment.
Check well cancer treatment working.
See cancer returned treatment.
need CEA test?
diagnosed type cancer cause high CEA levels, may need CEA testing:
treatment to:
Help understand serious cancer is.
Help guide treatment decisions.
Get measurement CEA level treatment compare CEA levels treatment.
cancer treatment see treatment working.

test starting cancer treatment, general:
low level CEAmay mean tumor small cancer spread parts body. cancers make much CEA, provider may use tests learn much cancer spread.
high level CEAmay mean larger tumor and/or cancer spread. need tests confirm serious cancer is.
test monitor cancer treatment, provider compare current CEA test results past test results. general:
Decreases CEA time often mean treatment working.
Increases CEA high levels stay highmay mean treatment working. example, surgery colorectal cancer, levels may mean entire tumor removed cancer growing back.
Decreases CEA treatment followed increasesmay mean cancer come back.
CEA levels remain high increase treatment always mean treatment working, cancer growing. So, CEA levels come down, provider likely order tests find why.
anything else need know CEA test?
